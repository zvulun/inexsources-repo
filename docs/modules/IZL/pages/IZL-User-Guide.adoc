[#s_Matching-an-Illuminator-to-Your-Camera-System]

=== Matching an Illuminator to Your Camera System

[NOTE]

========================================

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the {compname-short} camera. See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s).

========================================

The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows:

* Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances

* More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s) for an explanation of the model number codes (effective distances, and wavelengths/number of LEDs).
//*_\{Add {camera-5G} or GR here –
//since new pinout should allow for a
//strobe trigger as in the Driver Face Capture solution –
//and fix in catalog as well\}_*

|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power/Signals - Use type: Map UL2517; suggested manufacturer: TA YU; specification 24AWG x 6C + 16AWG x 2C + Mylar

* Be sure you can deliver 12 VDC or 24 VDC at the illuminator, even after all of the extensions have been added. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera's supply.

* If you are using the trigger function, be sure you can deliver the required trigger signal levels at the illuminator

|Mounting a|
* Typically on gantry

* Additional construction may be needed

|===

* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

* Be sure the opening at the rear of the unit is exposed to the ambient light, so that the photocell can sense the ambient light level
(see <<f_Photocell-Exposed-to-Ambient-Light-via-Rear-of-Unit>>) and <<s_Photocell-Trigger-and-Alarm-Behavior>>. +
(In some applications, the photocell may be disabled, so this consideration will not be relevant.)

== Mounting and Aiming

[#s_Overall-Mounting-Considerations]

=== Overall Mounting Considerations

* Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site's requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

[#s_Aiming-the-Illuminator]

=== Aiming the Illuminator

See your camera's User Guide for details on how to adjust the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition. As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan of the illuminator.

For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt, see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).


[#s_Connecting-the-Camera-System-Illuminator-Power-Supply-and-Network]

== Connecting the Camera System, Illuminator, Power Supply and Network

[WARNING]

========================================

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

If you are using an {compname-short} power supply, see its User Guide for important information.

========================================

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

[#s_Photocell-Trigger-and-Alarm-Behavior]

== Photocell, Trigger and Alarm Behavior

[#s_Photocell-Behavior]

=== Photocell Behavior

[NOTE]
================================
Depending on your project's requirements, the photocell may have been disabled.
================================

The illuminator's photocell (see <<f_Photocell-Exposed-to-Ambient-Light-via-Rear-of-Unit>>)
samples the ambient light 10 times per second:

* If all 10 readings are above or below the photocell's ambient light threshold (300 LUX), then the light turns ON or OFF accordingly.
* If all readings are not above/below the threshold, then the sampling is performed again.


=== Trigger Behavior (Input Signal)

The levels for the trigger (photocoupler) input are High (3.3 VDC - 24 VDC) and Low (0 VDC - 3.2 VDC and below).

* When the trigger input goes from Low to High:

** The input must be held High for approximately 200-300 ms (milliseconds) for the illuminator to turn ON.

** The photocell's effect on the illuminator will be disabled
(see <<s_Photocell-Behavior>>).

* When the trigger input goes from High to Low:

** The input must be held Low for approximately 200-300 ms
for the illuminator to turn OFF.

** If the trigger stays Low, the photocell will resume
sampling the ambient light, and take control of the
illuminator to turn it ON or OFF
accordingly (see <<s_Photocell-Behavior>>).
+
[NOTE]
===========================
Since a Low trigger signal returns illuminator control to the photocell, the illuminator cannot be forced OFF.
===========================

=== Alarm Behavior (Output Signal)

The levels for the alarm output are High (12 VDC) and Low (0 VDC).

* When the illuminator turns ON, the alarm output will go High (12 VDC) after approximately 200-300 ms.

* When the illuminator turns OFF, the alarm output will go Low (0 VDC) after approximately 200-300 ms.

== Configuring Management Software to Use with an Illuminator

Use the {compname-short} Camera System's management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software's User Guide for further details.

[NOTE]

========================================

Always wipe the window +++<u>+++gently+++</u>+++.

========================================

Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the illuminator. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently.
