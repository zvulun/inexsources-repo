=== Illuminator Models

The illuminator model codes are *{shortprodname}[1/2/3]-(IR/DR/CL/WL)-10/20/30/H40/60/H120*, where:

* After {shortprodname}:

* 1/2/3 - number of LEDs: 1=30, 2=60, 3=90

* WVLN = Wavelength/type of LEDs:

** IR - Infrared

** DR - Deep Red

** CL - Cool White (4000K)

** WL - Warm White (3000K)

* 10/20/30/H40/60/H120 - LED beam angle, in degrees (Notes: H40 = H40xV15; H120xV20-degree model available as {shortprodname}2-IR-H120)

[#s_Matching-an-Illuminator-to-Your-Camera-System]

=== Matching an Illuminator to Your Camera System

[NOTE]

========================================

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the {compname-short} camera. See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s).

========================================

The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows:

* Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances

* More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s) for an explanation of the model number codes (effective distances, and wavelengths/number of LEDs).
//*_\{Add {camera-5G} or GR here –
//since new pinout should allow for a
//strobe trigger as in the Driver Face Capture solution –
//and fix in catalog as well\}_*

|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the illuminator, depending on the power supply used

* Signals - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver the required strobe and RS485 signals at the illuminator.

|Mounting a|
* Typically on gantry

* Additional construction may be needed

|===

* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

* Be sure the opening at the rear of the unit is exposed to the ambient light, so that the photocell can sense the ambient light level (see <<f_Photocell-Exposed-to-Ambient-Light-via-Rear-of-Unit>>). +
(In some applications, the photocell may be disabled, so this consideration will not be relevant.)

== Mounting and Aiming

[#s_Overall-Mounting-Considerations]

=== Overall Mounting Considerations

* Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site's requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

[#s_Aiming-the-Illuminator]

=== Aiming the Illuminator

See your camera's User Guide for details on how to adjust the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition. As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan of the illuminator.

For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt, see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

[WARNING]

========================================

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

If you are using an {compname-short} power supply, see its User Guide for important information.

========================================

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

Here is a typical wiring diagram for capturing license plate images (the power supply type/configuration may be different at your site).

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If you need to add length to the power or signals
cables
(see <<s_Additional-Installation-Considerations>>),
be sure that: the supplied voltage (24 VDC)
reaches the illuminator, the strobe signal
levels you need reach the illuminator,
and the RS485 signal levels reach the
illuminator.

=== Configuring Management Software to Use with an Illuminator

Use the {compname-short} Camera System's management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software's User Guide for further details.
