== Playing Back and Downloading Stored Video (Playback Tab)

Use calendar to select date
Lower right button
Useful if train was missed, etc.
Download format above list of videos use MP4
Cameras are recording 24 hours, in segments
of 8 minutes each. Can select more videos
using page controls

Can search for a time period at top
which filters the green line at the
bottom for the day in which you selected
one of the videos. As will be described
below, you can also zoom in within this
selected time period using the buttons
at the lower right (24hr, 2hr, etc.)

This search period is reflected by
the length of the green line
at the bottom. You can click in the
green line or drag the small rectangle
at the start of the line to show
videos in other time periods - without
having to click on the right-side list
of video times.


Double-click on timing to show video
Lower left are video controls:

* Play/pause

* Stop - closes the video

* Next frame - pauses video, and moves to next
video frame; there are 5 frames
per second

* Slow (video must be playing) - click repeatedly to select
different rates as shown at lower left

* Fast (video must be playing) - click repeatedly to select
different rates as shown at lower left
Fast - will be fast
until the end of the 8 min period;
when next period is seen, it will
start to play at normal speed

Use buttons at lower right
to zoom in on a part of the video
scale green line will change; this is
useful for zooming in on a particular time;
notice that at a finer zoom, you can see
the small rectangle moving within the
green line. The scale of the green line
is adjusted to be some time before and
some time after the point selected when
the scale was 24 hours; for example if you
choose 4:00 in the morning, then click 30 minutes,
green line is now 3:45 to 4:15.

== Downloading
All downloads and recordings are saved in
this directory:
C:\Users\<current Windows username>\WebDownload\PlaybackRecord



Something else *_\{could it be
the selection on the green line?}_*is saved in:
C:\Users\<current Windows username>\WebDownload\VideoClips


There are several download modes
You must STOP (not pause) the currently
running video ("record") in order to
download.

File names are:
01.36.00-01.44.00[R][0@0][63674]
Time period, [R??],[0@0],[internal ID of the video segment]
The File Explorer date is the date
when the video was taken (but not the time -
you see the time in filename)

VLC player is the best way to see video
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html

Can also use Windows Media Player and other players



* From pane at right

** click the round button with
the arrow to download only that
8 min video segment


* Bulk download - this method is a lot faster
than clicking the individual buttons
in the previous technique
The reason is because the main screen
is using a lot of computing resources;
this is also why in the main screen
you have to stop the video before downloading

** use left button at bottom of right pane

** select date and time range for the
8 min video segments *_\{may be called records by dahua}_*you want to search

** Be sure to select the file type of mp4
at the bottom of this window before downloading
(search is not affected); file type will always
show as dav, but download will be according
to format you select

** can also select a different path for the
download - different then the default
noted above

** Use check boxes to select files;
there are page controls at the lower right
if you need to see more pages of search results

** Download Progress columns shows
progress

* Using Date and Green Line and Scissors

** In the main playback screen, select
a date from the calendar - but do not push
any of the buttons at the bottom

** Be sure the resolution of the green line
(24hr, 2 hr...) using the buttons at the lower
right - is set to the resolution you want

** Click on the green line for a starting
time for a video sample you want
to download, then click the scissors button
and be sure that starting video time
in the window is correct. This is the left
value in the window - do not pay attention
yet to the end time - it may be from a
previous selection

** click on the green line for the end time
of the video sample, and click the scissors
button. Verify that the end time is correct
in the window. (Do not pay attention
to the video displayed, it is running
from the end time forward but does not
affect what we are doing)

** Click the diskette button to download
the video segment you selected.

** This gives you one file instead of
several 8 min files. The application
finds all of the 8 min segments that
encompass the time period you selected
and puts them together into one file.
Note that since the time you selected
will probably not be on an exact border
between 8 min segments, the date range
on the downloaded file may be slightly
earlier and later than the times you selected.

** download is very slow; cannot play
any other videos while this download is happening;
video must be stopped
