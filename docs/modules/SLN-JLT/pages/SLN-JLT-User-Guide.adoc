saved in: +
C:\Users\<current Windows username>\WebDownload\PlaybackRecord

*Downloads from bulk downloads are saved
by default in (can be changed):

There are several download modes
You must STOP (not pause) the currently

download.

Button download: click on button
changes to "x" so you can stop it
number to right of button shows progress

File names of button downloads are:
01.36.00-01.44.00[R][0@0][63674]
Time period, [R??],[0@0],[internal ID of the video segment]
The File Explorer date is the date
when the video was taken (but not the time -
you see the time in filename)

VLC player is the best way to see video
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html

Can also use Windows Media Player and other players



* From pane at right

** click the round button with
the arrow to download only that
8 min video segment


* Bulk download - this method is a lot faster
than clicking the individual buttons
in the previous technique
The reason is because the main screen
is using a lot of computing resources;
this is also why in the main screen
you have to stop the video before downloading

** use left button at bottom of right pane

** select date and time range for the
8-minute video segments you want to search for

** Be sure to select the file type of mp4
at the bottom of this window before downloading
(search is not affected); file type will always
show as dav, but download will be according
to format you select

** can also select a different path for the
download - different then the default
noted above

** Use check boxes to select files;
there are page controls at the lower right
if you need to see more pages of search results

** Download Progress columns shows
progress

* Using Date and Green Line and Scissors

image::ROOT:SLN-JLT/image-timeline-segment-select.png[image,500]

** In the main playback screen, select
a date from the calendar - but do not push
any of the buttons at the bottom

** Be sure the resolution of the green line
(24hr, 2 hr...) using the buttons at the lower
right - is set to the resolution you want

** Click on the green line for a starting
time for a video sample you want
to download, then click the scissors button
and be sure that starting video time
in the window is correct. This is the left
value in the window - do not pay attention
yet to the end time - it may be from a
previous selection

** click on the green line for the end time
of the video sample, and click the scissors
button. Verify that the end time is correct
in the window. (Do not pay attention
to the video displayed, it is running
from the end time forward but does not
affect what we are doing)

** Click the diskette button to download
the video segment you selected.

** This gives you one file instead of
several 8 min files. The application
finds all of the 8 min segments that
encompass the time period you selected
and puts them together into one file.
Note that since the time you selected
will probably not be on an exact border
between 8 min segments, the date range
on the downloaded file may be slightly
earlier and later than the times you selected.

** download is very slow; cannot play
any other videos while this download is happening;
video must be stopped

[#s_Logging-In-to-RoadView]

== Using Roadview to View Events
An Event is a train that enters or leaves a station.


=== Logging In to RoadView

. To access the {software-ALPR} application for each station,
use the same IP, but a different port for the
{software-ALPR} application; same IP as cameras,
but different port for the RV box
for example http://95.35.29.15:7110
root, root

=== Using RoadView

*_\{explain as you did in the RV manual
use attributes for vehicle/car/train ?
note that trains are tracked by number
on side of second car in train
Trains consist of several train cars connected
together;
an Event is identified by the number
on the second train car. All of the
data about the event such as
door open/close status are for this
second car}_*

Reports are sent at 0400 A.M. every day
showing events from last 24 hours; show
example

Same daily reports can be send from
reports tab (see buttons at right)
or downloaded

Reports have links to DPU storage to see images

Calibration tab is really live - click
on video screen to pause, click again to restart
Select which camera from menu at right, but
don't change the ROI, plate width, or direction arrow

Live tab is not really live  - it shows a still picture
of the last event (triggered when train leaves station)

. If you are using IE or Chrome with the IE plugin,
or Edge running in IE mode, you
may be asked to download a plugin to be able
to view video.

.. Click on the displayed "download the plugin" link

.. When prompted, click Run at the bottom of the screen

.. Click Allow at the next prompts
