a|* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).
|*Camera Configuration and Mounting* a|* Refer to the relevant installation and configuration documentation for your camera(s). The cameras should be configured, mounted and connected to the LAN before mounting and configuring the {shortprodname}.

[%collapsible]
====

[IMPORTANT]

========================================
If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable's shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures).

If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable.

[#s_Connect-Components-Wiring]

== Connect Components (Wiring)

[WARNING]

========================================

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

Turn off/disconnect the any external (AC) power supplies before connecting cables.

========================================

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

*All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.*

[NOTE]

========================================

Events can be sent to {software-server} using the {compname-short} HTTP API.

Events can be sent to 3^rd^ party systems using the {compname-short} HTTP API and/or the {compname-short} ZAP Protocol (see the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide for configuration details). See <<s_Related-Documents>>.

[#s_Power-Up-and-Set-Up-IP]

== Power Up and Set Up IP

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

=== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {shortprodname} and cameras have been
pre-configured with default IP addresses.
You will probably need to change these addresses
to conform to the requirements of your network.
Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for
all components of your ALPR system ({shortprodname}
and cameras).

[#s_Connecting-the-AC-Electricity]

=== Connecting the AC Electricity

[WARNING]
========================================
If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that
all components receive exactly their rated voltage.

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect
polarity will damage the unit and will void the
warranty.

Stable power at the correct level must be supplied
to each component, even when under a heavy processing
load.
========================================

. Connect the AC power to the {shortprodname}'s power supply
. Plug the barrel connector into the {shortprodname}
. Press the POWER button on the front panel
. Verify that the {shortprodname} has started to
operate properly (see <<s_Verifying-Initial-Operation>>)

[#s_Verifying-Initial-Operation]

=== Verifying Initial Operation

With power applied, you should see that:

* The Power and Status LEDs on the back panel light up (see <<s_Back-Panel>>)

* The LAN connector LEDs on the left panel light/flash to indicate network activity (see <<s_Left-Panel>>)

If the LEDs do not light as expected check if:

* The cable(s) are carrying power all the way to reach the unit.

* The LAN cable is connected properly to the unit.

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

=== Set Up IP

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active
devices connected to the network, and displays a
list of their network parameters.
These devices can include cameras and computers.

See the {software-discovery} User Guide
(see <<s_Related-Documents>>) for instructions
on how to change the unit's IP address.

[#s_Verify-System-Operation]

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or
by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that
an Event is generated with the correct plate read
(recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal)
tab - see the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide).
See <<s_Related-Documents>>.

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events
are being generated for each vehicle passing each
camera, and that the recognition has sufficient
accuracy and confidence.
