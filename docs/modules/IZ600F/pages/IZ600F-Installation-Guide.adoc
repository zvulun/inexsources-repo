== Plan Your Site

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified.

Reflectivity: +
- Different levels of reflectivity will change the specified distances +
- By "Non-reflective", we mean that the colors have good contrast (black on white, for example), and all colors used in the plate are matte (dull finish). +
- Other Non-reflective schemes (special colors, for example) may change the specified distances. Contact {compname-med} for advice.

========================================

[#s_Installation-Overview-Plate-Types]

=== Installation Overview/Plate Types

. You will first need to determine the ambient lighting conditions (illumination) at your site.

. The lighting conditions may require you to use an external
illuminator (see <<s_Optimizing-Nighttime-Vehicle-Overview-Images-using-External-Illuminators>>).
You may only be able to determine this during camera
configuration.

. Determine the plate types you will be recognizing: reflective, non-reflective or IR (infrared-type)-phobic. Note that both reflective and non-reflective plates can be IR-phobic, as shown in these examples:

** *Reflective IR-phobic plates* use character ink that is transparent to IR light. The IR images of these characters are filled with a color very close to that of the plate's background. This makes it more difficult for an ALPR algorithm to recognize the characters.
+
[#f_Reflective-IR-phobic-Plate-Example]

.Reflective IR-phobic Plate Example

image::./UserGuide/image4.png[image,width=184,height=207]
+
** *Non-reflective IR-phobic plates* typically have a combination of red and white characters/background, which reduces the contrast between the characters and the background. This makes it more difficult for an ALPR algorithm to recognize the characters:
+
[#f_Non-Reflective-IR-phobic-Plate-Examples]

.Non-Reflective IR-phobic Plate Examples

image::./UserGuide/image5.png[image,width=187,height=179]
+
. Install the camera as described in the following sections.

. Depending upon whether or not the illumination is sufficient at night,
and the plate types you need to recognize,
you may need to perform the camera calibration and configuration
first under dark conditions, and then light (day) conditions.
//with the Day & Night Control set
//to Auto (Night (see <<s_Camera-Setup>>). If you will also
//have to recognize plates under light (day) conditions,
//change the Day & Night Control afterwards to Auto.

|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each camera, even under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

*+++<u>+++IMPORTANT+++</u>+++*

+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Supplied cable lengths are approx. 5.5 in (14 cm)

* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 12 VDC at the camera

* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable (without a switch) should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements

* Vehicle types

* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)

* Recessed plates

|Trigger Hardware (such as inductive loops) a|
* Trigger device position

* Device is far enough away from other devices to minimize interference

* Point where vehicle is detected is close to capture line

* Minimize distance from trigger device to camera (reduces latency)

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads);
avoid having these items in the Field of View a|
* Fences with patterns

* Barriers

* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates

* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)

* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into camera's front window

* Reflective surfaces too close to camera lens

* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms

* Dirt on front window (see <<s_Cleaning-the-Camera>>)

[#s_Adding-a-User]

==== Adding a User

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The built-in Administrator username and password is root, IZpass12.
*+++<u>+++However, it is highly recommended to create at least one other
user (with more restrictive permissions) which should be publicized instead.+++</u>+++*

*It is also highly recommended to change the built-in Administrator's
password (using the System > Admin. Password parameter group -
see <<s_Changing-Administrator-Password>>) occasionally to keep the
camera secure. However, if this password is lost, you will have to
reset the device with the FD (Factory Default) button
(see <<s_Hardware-Reset-Resets-Parameters-and-Administrator-Password>>).
All setting values will be reverted to their factory defaults, and any
additional user accounts that were created will be deleted.*

Only the Administrator (or a registered user with an Administrator role)
can see the Admin (configuration) screens via the web interface.

========================================

[NOTE]

========================================

The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with the following format (assuming you have set the correct permissions in the camera for the user - see the explanations in this section):

rtsp://[username:password]@<Camera IP address>/cam0_0 +
where cam0_0 are camera-specific parameters (which in this case enable you to access the primary stream)

Record this URL with the username and password details for use when setting parameters in {compname-short} management software.

========================================

To add a user:

. Log in to the camera (see <<s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera>>).

. Navigate to the System > Access Level configuration page,
and select the Access Level you need (see <<s_Access-Level>>).
+

* *If System > Access Level = Full Access (recommended initial setting
before defining other users and their permissions):*

** *Anyone (even a non-registered user) can use the Live View*

** *The RTSP URL can be used without a user name and password
to see the Live View* +

* If you want to limit access to the camera by registering users,
you must set the System > Access Level to Limited Access (see <<s_Access-Level>>). If so, then:

** Users must be registered with a password to see the Live View
via the web interface. Note: Since @ is used as a separator in the
RTSP URL syntax, it is recommended +++<u>+++not+++</u>+++ to use this character in the
password.

** The RTSP URL must be used with a user name and password,
and the user must be at an Administrator role level to see the
Live View.

. Navigate to System > User (see <<f_User-Screen-System-User>>):

[#s_Hardware-Reset-Resets-Parameters-and-Administrator-Password]

=== Hardware Reset (Resets Parameters and Administrator Password)

In some cases (such as if the Administrator password is lost),
you will need to perform a hardware reset using the FD (Factory Default)
button. *All setting values will be reverted to their
factory defaults. The IP address will be reset to 10.20.30.40.*
//*Any additional user accounts that were created will
//be deleted (see <<s_Adding-a-User>>).*

To perform a hardware reset:

. Unscrew the round cover on the bottom of the camera:

.Unscrewing the Round Cover

image::ROOT:IZ600F/IZ600F-30-FIG-018_Bottom_Opening.png[image,width=192,height=183]

. Locate the Factory Default (reset) button (see <<f_Factory-Default-Reset-Button-and-LEDs>>).

. Using a thin item such as a small screwdriver, hold the button down for several seconds until the communication LEDs shut off. The 2 communication LEDs (red/flashing and green/static) are mounted next to each another on the same side of the circuit board you see.

. After the communication LEDs shut off, wait until they light up again. You can then use the camera and configure its parameters.

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Plan-Your-Site>>
and the {docproductname} User Guide - see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.

[IMPORTANT]
========================================
See <<s_Determining-the-IP-Address-of-the-RoadView-Computer-with-IZ-Discovery>> and <<s_Using-RoadView>> for instructions on how to log in to the computer running {software-ALPR} in your system.

See the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>) for calibration instructions.

Read the following instructions before adjusting the camera's position as part of the calibration procedure; they are specifically for the {shortprodname} camera.

*+++<u>+++DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN the two Roll screws (3). Excess force can cause the screws to break! There are two Roll screws - one on each side.+++</u>+++*

========================================

To aim the camera, adjust the Pan (screw 2),
Tilt (screw 1) and Roll (screw 3) as described
in these instructions, and in the {software-ALPR-long}
User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).
Use the 3 mm Allen/hex key provided to loosen
and tighten the adjustment screws.

[#f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments]

.Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments

image::./UserGuide/image39.png[image,width=387,height=167]

[NOTE]
========================================
The inner mechanisms of adjustments 2 (pan) and
1 (tilt) (see <<f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments>>)
have small teeth. When the teeth mesh with protrusions
in the housing, the adjustment position becomes
fixed in place. Each tooth corresponds to a
certain number of degrees of angle (6° per tooth).
However, the distance between each tooth is
not always small enough for finer adjustments
(that are often required to aim the camera).
If the camera is used with a pole mount adapter,
you can achieve these finer adjustments by
moving the adapter slightly - around the pole.
========================================

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab,
or by driving a vehicle through the lane,
verify that an Event is generated with the
correct plate read (recorded in the
{software-ALPR} Live (Journal) tab).
See the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events
are being generated for each vehicle passing each
camera, and that the recognition has sufficient
accuracy and confidence.
