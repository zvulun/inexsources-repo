== Required/Optional Accessories (Not Included)

[#s_Required-Accessories]

=== Required Accessories

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

*Surge protection must be provided on all power, network and data cables*

All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

========================================

* Power supply:

** 12VDC, 1.2 Amp power supply, with male barrel connector (5.5 mm outer diameter, 2.1 mm inner diameter), or

** PoE (IEEE 802.3af) switch capable of providing 12VDC at 1.2 Amp

[#f_Male-Barrel-Connector]

.Male Barrel Connector

image::./UserGuide/image3.jpeg[Image result for barrel connector,width=75,height=75]

* Waterproof insulating tape (such as butyl tape)

* Network cabling (typically CAT 5e/6 cable) and switch. The total length of the cable from the network switch to the camera should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

* Laptop computer to use for calibration and configuration, with the following requirements:

** Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in "Windows Features"

** Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser

* A list of accessories that can be supplied by {compname-med} can be found at the end of the Specifications (see <<s_Specifications>>).

[#s_Optional-Accessories]

=== Optional Accessories

* Pole mount adapter (PMA) - see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

* External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the camera's supply.

** Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

** Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

== Recognizing Devices with {software-discovery}

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

See the {software-discovery} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

[#s_Configuring-the-Camera]

== Configuring Camera Settings

See your camera's Installation Guide
for detailed instructions (see <<s_Related-Documents>>.)

[#s_Using-RoadView]

== Using {software-ALPR}

{software-ALPR} is advanced ALPR software that reads license plates using sophisticated image recognition algorithms, and creates LPR Events.

[#s_Determining-the-IP-Address-of-the-RoadView-Computer-with-IZ-Discovery]

=== Determining the IP Address of the {software-ALPR} Computer with {software-discovery}

See the {software-discovery} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

== Maintenance

[#s_Checking-Mounting-Screws]

=== Checking Mounting Screws

It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years.

[#s_Cleaning-the-Camera]

=== Cleaning the Camera

Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the camera. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the ALPR camera's front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window +++<u>+++gently+++</u>+++.
