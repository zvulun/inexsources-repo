== Background

This document describes how to configure {compname-short} camera(s)
to work with {software-cloud}.

[discrete]
== Applicable Product

A {software-cloud}-integrated {compname-short} camera running
with the latest {software-ALPR} release.

[discrete]
== You Will Need
* Computer with Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in "Windows Features"
* Chrome or Edge browser

[discrete]
== Purchasing an {software-cloud} Subscription

Contact {compname-short} to purchase an
{software-cloud} subscription. If needed, {compname-short}
will provide further instructions on how to configure
the {software-cloud} Integration in {software-ALPR}

<<<

[discrete]
== Configuring {software-cloud} in {software-ALPR}
* Open a browser with the the IP address of the {software-ALPR} computer
address you configured (usually running on the camera). +
For example: +
{ip-default-IZA-DPU}

* Enter the default username/password = root/root

* You should see the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal) tab.

* Click on the Settings tab at the top of the screen

* Scroll down to the {software-cloud} Integration section

* Enable {software-cloud} Integration and
set the parameters as follows. *Remember to click the Save button at the end of the
Detector Configuration section after making changes.*

<<<

The {software-cloud} server has different Vehicle
Lists containing registered plate reads. These
lists can be entered in {software-cloud} manually,
or via integration with a 3rd party access control
system. These lists are used in some cases as
explained in the following items:

[NOTE]
===============================
When {software-cloud} Integration is enabled,
an additional tab (Access Lists) will appear,
depending on the {software-ALPR} version you
are using (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).
===============================

* *URL* - The URL of the {software-cloud} account
* *Tenant ID* - ID of the relevant {software-cloud} account
* *User Name* - {software-cloud} account user name
* *Password* - {software-cloud} account password
* *Ambiguity Chars* - If an exact match to a plate
cannot be done, Ambiguity
(also called Normalization) is enabled.
The characters in a plate read that could be mistaken
for other characters will be changed to their
associated ambiguity value during the plate-to-list
matching process. +
Note that the list is bi-directional.
For example, in addition to "8" being used
instead of "B", "B" will be used instead of "8".

* *Push Video to Server* - When enabled, {software-ALPR}
sends images to the {software-cloud} server.
You will also see an additional parameter:
** *Send Camera Image Timeout* - How often images are sent to the
{software-cloud} server.

* *Min Width for Fuzzy Match* - If the number of
characters in the LPR plate read is less than this
value, then fuzzy matching will +++<u>+++not+++</u>+++
be used to match this plate to the Vehicle List.
Only exact or Ambiguity matching will be used.

* *Match On*
** *Exact* - An attempt is made to make an exact
match, and an Ambiguity match - until all
characters in the plate read match exactly
to an item in the Vehicle List.

** *N-1* - An attempt is made to make an exact
match, and an Ambiguity match - until all
characters in the plate read match to an
item in the Vehicle List –
except for +++<u>+++one+++</u>+++ wrong character.

** *N-2* - An attempt is made to make an exact
match, and an Ambiguity match - until all
characters in the plate read match to an
item in the Vehicle List –
except for +++<u>+++two+++</u>+++ wrong characters.

* *Keep-Alive Enabled* - When enabled, {software-ALPR} will
sense the Keep Alive messages sent from the {software-cloud} server.
If not enabled, these messages will be ignored.

** *Keep-Alive Interval* - If {software-ALPR} does not receive a Keep Alive
message from the {software-cloud} server for this amount of time,
multiplied by the Keep-Alive Fail Count, then {software-ALPR} will re-establish the
connection with the {software-cloud} server.

** *Keep-Alive Fail Count* - The number of Keep-Alive Intervals for
which {software-ALPR} will wait (if no Keep Alive messages are received from the
{software-cloud} server) before re-establishing the connection with the {software-cloud}
server.

* *Get Access List Timeout* - How long {software-ALPR} waits after sending a
request for access lists from the {software-cloud} server. If
{software-ALPR} does not receive access lists for this amount of time,
{software-ALPR} will stop sending the request.

* *Lanes*

** *Lane ID* - This table is automatically
populated with the number of lanes defined in
the Lanes section at the bottom of the Settings
tab.

** *GPIO* - The +++<u><b>+++nn+++</u></b>+++ number
that identifies the GPIO+++<u><b>+++nn+++</u></b>+++
pin on the NVIDIA Jetson processor's I/O module.
A signal is sent to this pin when a {software-ALPR}
plate read has a match with an {software-cloud}
Vehicle List (expected plate reads). This is
typically used to open a gate. See the NVIDIA Jetson
documentation for further information.

** *EXIT* - When enabled, all vehicles are
allowed to pass through the device connected
to the GPIO. This option is typically used for
exit gates.

** *Remote URL* - A request is sent to this URL
when there is a match with an {software-cloud}
Vehicle List (expected plate reads).
This is typically used to open a gate
via a web relay. The request is sent in a special
format (see the Web Relay documentation
referenced in <<s_Related-Documents>>). +
+
[NOTE]
========================
In addition to the GPIO and Remote URL
signals/requests, a signal is also sent to the
camera; this signal can be used to open a gate
via a relay (depends on the capabilities of the
camera model).
========================

* *Wiegand Controller (Converter) Enabled* -
For each plate in a Vehicle List, a Wiegand code
can be added to use if there is an LPR match.
({software-cloud} also stores a Sentinel
(No Match) Wiegand code if no plate match
is found for any plate.) +
+
If there is a plate match, the Wiegand code
will be used. Some cameras have the capability
to send this code directly to an access control
panel or device. +
+
However, if the access control panel is too
far from the camera to be connected physically,
or if the camera does not have Wiegand capabilities,
then this option should be enabled.
The Wiegand code will be sent via network to a
Wiegand converter, which will then send the code
to the access control panel or device.

** *Lane ID* - This table is automatically
populated with the number of lanes defined in
the Lanes section at the bottom of the Settings
tab.

** *WIC IP* - The IP address of the Wiegand
converter assigned to the Lane.

** *WIC Port* - The port on the Wiegand converter
used by {software-ALPR} to communicate with the
Wiegand converter; 1001 is the default port
on the Wiegand converter.

* *Remember to click the Save button at the end
of the Detector Configuration section after
making changes.*
