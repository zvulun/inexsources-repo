== Face Recognition

//pictures of face recognition, driver in car, etc.

Our advanced face recognition algorithms scan and match faces from various locations within the airport - terminal entrances, on streets, or even in vehicles.
Identification of individuals of interest can generate real-time alerts, ensuring that potential security threats are identified and addressed early.

== Vehicle Security

//pictures of face recognition

{compname-short} AI license plate recognition quickly and accurately idenitifies blacklisted vehicles, ensuring immediate action at roads or checkpoints.
This capability provides increased perimeter and parking lot security, prevention of unauthorized vehicles from accessing sensitive areas, and timely responses to potential threats.

== Unattended Baggage

//pictures of baggage and thermal cameras


Unattended baggage is an security threat that is often overlooked.
Cameras \{ZT: don't think there are sensors\} identify baggage left unattended for prolonged periods, alerting security teams instantly.


[discrete]
== Terminal Population Count
Real-time people counting systems can keep track of the number of individuals in the terminal at any given moment.
This enables efficient crowd management, better resource allocation during peak times, and swift emergency evacuation when needed.


[discrete]
== Crowding Alerts
Areas that often experience crowding can be monitored, such as security checks, check-ins, and baggage claim zones.
Passenger experience can be enhanced by preventing prolonged waiting times, and ensuring optimal staff allocation during rush hours.
