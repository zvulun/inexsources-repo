== Executive Summary
In the modern age, airport security is not just a matter
of routine checks. It has evolved into a
comprehensive ecosystem that incorporates
cutting-edge technologies to ensure the safety
of all airport users, from passengers to staff.
Today's airports need to be at the forefront of this revolution. +

Introducing the {compname-short} Solution for {shortprodname}:

== Face Recognition

image:FaceRecognitionScan.jpg[image,width=300] {empty} image:FaceRecognizeOnStreet.jpg[image,width=340]

Our advanced face recognition algorithms scan
and match faces from various locations within
the airport - terminal entrances, on streets, or even in vehicles.
Identification of suspected individuals on a watchlist can
generate real-time alerts, ensuring that potential
security threats are identified and addressed early.

== Vehicle Security

image:VehicleAlertEmail.png[image,width=300] {empty} image:BlackList.png[image,width=360]

{compname-short} AI license plate recognition quickly
and accurately identifies blacklisted vehicles,
ensuring immediate action at roads or checkpoints.
This capability provides increased perimeter and
parking lot security, prevention of unauthorized
vehicles from accessing sensitive areas,
and timely responses to potential threats.


[discrete]
== Unattended Baggage

//pictures of baggage and thermal cameras
image::UnattendedBag.jpg[image,width=300,align=left]

Unattended baggage is a security threat often overlooked.
Cameras identify baggage left unattended for prolonged periods,
alerting security teams instantly. The system can associate each
piece of baggage with its original owner, reducing false alerts caused
by other people in the vicinity of the abandoned bag.


[discrete]
== Suspicious Behavior

--
+++<div class="pagebreak"> </div>+++
--


People tracking systems can alert security personnel
to suspicious behaviors.
These include people running, walking in the opposite direction,
stopping, or not carrying baggage.
Such alerts can provide early warning of
potential security threats.

== Terminal Population Count and Crowding Detection

//pictures same size

image:AirportPopulationCount.png[image,width=300,align=left] {empty}
image:Crowding.jpg[image,width=280,align=left]

Real-time people counting systems can determine the number
of individuals in the terminal at any given moment.
This enables efficient terminal management, better
resource allocation during peak times,
and swift emergency evacuation when needed.

Areas that often experience crowding can be monitored,
such as security checks, check-ins, and baggage claim zones.
You can enhance your passenger experience by preventing
prolonged waiting times, and ensuring optimal staff
allocation during rush hours.

== Intelligent AI Video Analytics

image::CarTypeIdentified.jpg[image,width=300,align=left]

Integrated with AI-driven video analytics, our system
pairs seamlessly with your existing CCTV infrastructure,
and maximizes accuracy while reducing false positives. +++<br>+++
For example, our ALPR analytics can determine
the classification, color and make of a vehicle.

== Virtual Patrols

image::VirtualPatrolOperator.jpg[image,width=300,align=left]

Virtual patrol is a concept that includes several
of the video-based airport security system
features mentioned here.
You can use technology to simulate
or enhance traditional physical patrolling
conducted by security personnel, especially in areas
off-limits to normal people traffic.
A site can be monitored remotely without the
need for on-site guards.
