== Background

{software-cloud} ALPR Performance Monitoring software ({software-cloud}-APM)
is an advanced SaaS (Software as a Service) application.

This document describes how to use the
{software-cloud} Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) Performance Monitoring application
to work with the
{docproductname} {docproductname3} System.
{software-cloud} opens a gate for an Uber or Lyft vehicle
that has been authorized to pick up a passenger
at this time, or that is on a
Whitelist.

//* Monitor real-time Events seamlessly
//*_\{not available from GKSYS user - only admin}_* * Benefit from daily analytical reports, which provide
//insights into ALPR performance
If a vehicle on a Blacklist attempts to pass the gate,
an alert (alarm) is displayed. A list of
alarms can be viewed and searched.

You can perform many useful actions, including:

* View live Events

* Quickly and accurately search for
individual plates/owners from a
list of Events

* Add/remove vehicles from Whitelists/Blacklists

* Search for and process Blacklist alarms

== Computer and Software Requirements
* Computer running with Windows 10 or later
* Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser

[#s_IZCloud-Integration]

== {software-cloud} Configuration via {software-ALPR}

* Log in to {software-ALPR} (see the {software-ALPR}

{The read rate for the last day
We only use a maximum of 1000 events from the Review Tool;
The reviewed events are only qualified (human-readable) reads;
Numbers in tooltips are the number of reads reviewed -
usually only about 80% of total eVents for the day
because he rest are non-qualified}

These graphs show data from "reviewed reads".
"Reviewed reads" are the Qualifed (human-readable) plate reads
(out of the total reads for a certain day) that were reviewed.

*** Hover over a bar to show details for the previous day's
