[#s_Power-LAN-Cable-Options]

=== Power/LAN Cable Options

The IZ Composite or prefabricated Power/LAN cables are custom-made for {system-type} camera applications.

* If you have an IZ Composite Cable, you will need to connect one end to the connector plug supplied with the {shortprodname} camera (see <<s_Connecting-the-IZ-Composite-Cable-to-the-Power-LAN-Connector-Plug>>).

* If you have a prefabricated Power/LAN cable, the connector plug is already attached to one end.

* The other end of the cable consists of flying leads that will need to be connected to the {hw-connection-panel} terminal block connections (see <<s_Connecting-the-IZ-Panel>>)

[#s_Connecting-the-IZ-Composite-Cable-to-the-Power-LAN-Connector-Plug]

=== Connecting the IZ Composite Cable to the Power/LAN Connector Plug

Refer to <<f_Female-Connector-Plug-Assembly>> when following the instructions in this section.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

Since you will need access to the power/LAN panel connector on the camera to perform this procedure, you should follow these instructions before mounting the camera.

========================================

[#f_Female-Connector-Plug-Assembly]

.Female Connector Plug Assembly

image::image18.png[image,width=624,height=409]

. Measure the length of IZ Composite Cable you will need. Be sure to allow extra length for the parts of the cable that have to:

** Pass through the connector

** Go around bends

** Reach far enough to reach terminals in a connection box, if applicable
+

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The maximum cable length for proper LAN connectivity via an {hw-connection-panel} is 200 feet (61 m)

At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the drain (shield) wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the drain wire connected to the connector plug.

========================================
+

. Unscrew and separate all of the Power/LAN connector plug parts, including the "female insert" part that exposes the screw terminals inside the plug (see <<f_Female-Connector-Plug-Assembly>>). If the parts are connected together, you can separate the insert as follows:

.. Attach the connector plug to a male panel connector (either on the Camera System, or an {illum-VES} illuminator). Be sure the notch on the plug lines up with the protrusion on the panel connector.

.. Tighten the outer insert ring onto the panel connector to fix it in place.

.. Unscrew the outer sleeve ring from the hood.

.. Match the bevels inside the hood to the bevels of the sleeve.

.. Loosen the sleeve with a series of partial turns (so the wires won't get twisted inside the hood):

... Small turn

... Remove hood from sleeve

... Rotate hood back to original position

... Replace hood on sleeve

... Make another small turn

.. When the sleeve is loose enough, you can loosen it the rest of the way by rotating the sleeve's bevels.

.. Release the outer insert ring and remove the plug from the connector

. Thread the cable through the pressing screw, pinch ring, and "seal" ring.
+
[#f_Threading-the-Cable-Through-the-Screw-Ring-and-Seal]

.Threading the Cable Through the Screw, Ring and Seal

image::image19.png[image,width=204,height=321]

. Thread the cable into the bottom of the hood and out though the top of the hood. Continue threading the cable through the sleeve.
+
[#f_Threading-the-Cable-Through-the-Hood-and-Sleeve]

.Threading the Cable Through the Hood and Sleeve

image::image20.png[image,width=334,height=202]

. If needed, turn the inner part of the insert to the desired position. This is typically done with the notch towards the "bottom" (in the same direction as the bottom of the hood). This typical position will enable the cables to leave the connector plug directly towards the back of the Camera System.
+
[#f_Connector-Plugs-with-Cables-Attached-to-Camera]

.Connector Plugs with Cables Attached to Camera

image::image21.png[image,width=401,height=356]

. Strip off the outer rubber insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires at a length of 0.8-1.0 in (20-25 mm). There should be enough length in the wires to enable turning the hood to a different position (see <<f_Pin-Numbers-Near-Screw-Terminals>>). *Be careful not to cut into the shield mesh surrounding the inside of the cable, the drain wire strands, and the plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

. Pull the shield mesh and plastic jacket back along the cable to expose the drain wire. The drain wire is the same color as the shield mesh, and is composed of several strands wound together (see <<f_Locating-the-Drain-Wire>>).
+
[#f_Locating-the-Drain-Wire]

.Locating the Drain Wire

image::image22.png[image,width=407,height=218]

. Carefully cut away a small amount of the jackets enclosing pairs of the individual insulated wires. Separate the wires.

. Strip off 0.2 in (5 mm) from each insulated wire (lead).

. Insert each flying lead (stripped wires and drain wire) into the appropriate screw terminal, and tighten the terminal's screw with a 0.1 in (2.5 mm) flat screwdriver. The wire colors and pinouts are shown in the following Figure (see <<f_Building-the-Power-LAN-Cable-with-IZ-COMPOSITE-CABLE>>). You can see small pin numbers near each screw terminal (see <<f_Pin-Numbers-Near-Screw-Terminals>>).
+
--

[NOTE]

========================================

The screw terminal for the drain wire is in the middle of the insert, with the screw threaded up from the bottom (see <<f_Screw-Terminals-for-Drain-and-Power-LAN-Connections>>).

All wire colors are those used in the IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE and IZCAB-A{system-type} cables.

. Verify that there is conductivity from the drain wire (at the end of the cable with the flying leads) to the drain pin on the connector plug.

. Attach the connector plug to a male panel connector (either on the Camera System, or an {illum-VES} illuminator). Be sure the notch on the plug lines up with the protrusion on the panel connector.

. Tighten the outer insert ring onto the panel connector to fix it in place.

. Hold the sleeve bevels and being to tighten the sleeve onto the insert

. When you can no longer tighten the sleeve with your fingers, continue a small additional tightening using the bevels to make partial turns, as described in the following steps (so the wires won't get twisted inside the hood):

+
--
[IMPORTANT]

========================================

Be sure to tighten the sleeve just enough to feel a little resistance. This will enable the connector plug to be rotated more once it is connected to the camera (see <<f_Connector-Plugs-with-Cables-Attached-to-Camera>>).

========================================
--

.. Match the bevels inside the hood to the bevels of the sleeve.

.. Make a small turn

.. Remove the hood from the sleeve

.. Rotate the hood back to its original position

.. Replace the hood on the sleeve

.. Make another small turn

. Once you have finished tightening the sleeve, turn the hood to the desired angle which for which you want the cable to leave the camera (see <<f_Connector-Plugs-with-Cables-Attached-to-Camera>>).

. Slide the hood along the cable towards the terminal connections by pulling the cable out the bottom of the hood. Leave a small amount space between the hood and the sleeve - this will enable you to loosen/adjust the sleeve in the future (by moving the hood away to make partial turns).

. The sleeve ring's threads (inside the ring facing the bevels) attach the sleeve to the hood's threads; use the sleeve's ring to tighten the attachment.

. Slide the seal, pinch ring and pressing screw nut along the cable. Push the seal all the way up into the hood.
+
[#f_Power-LAN-Cable-Pushing-the-Seal-into-the-Hood]

.Power/LAN Cable: Pushing the Seal into the Hood

image::image26.png[image,width=285,height=196]

. Slide the pinch ring into the bottom of the hood.

. Tighten the pressing screw to push the other parts up into the hood. Maximum recommended torque is 10.2 kgf.cm / 1.0 N.m. up to 12.7 kgf.cm / 1.25 N.m.

[#s_Preparing-the-Cable-Leads-IZ-COMPOSITE-CABLE]

=== Preparing the Cable Leads (IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE)

If you have built the Power/LAN Cable using the IZ_COMPOSITE_CABLE, follow these instructions:

[NOTE]

========================================

To attach the cables to the camera, tighten the outer insert ring onto the corresponding panel connector (see <<f_Female-Connector-Plug-Assembly>>).

After connecting the cables to the camera, you can still rotate them slightly to achieve the desired angle (see <<f_Connector-Plugs-with-Cables-Attached-to-Camera>>). If you need a bigger rotation, see <<s_Connecting-the-IZ-Composite-Cable-to-the-Power-LAN-Connector-Plug>>on page link:#_Ref107135228[24].

For a wiring diagram, see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams>>.

========================================

. From the end of the Power/LAN cable to be connected to the power supply and LAN, strip off the outer rubber insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires at an appropriate length for connection to the {hw-connection-panel} (see <<s_Connecting-the-IZ-Panel>>). *Be careful not to cut into the shield mesh surrounding the inside of the cable, the drain wire strands, and the plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

. Pull the shield mesh and plastic jacket back along the cable to expose the drain wire. The drain wire is the same color as the shield mesh, and is composed of several strands wound together (see <<f_Locating-the-Drain-Wire>>).

. Carefully cut away an appropriate amount from the jackets enclosing pairs of the individual insulated wires. Separate the wires.

. Strip off 0.2 in (5 mm) from each insulated wire (lead).

[WARNING]

========================================

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty. Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to the Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

**If you are using an {compname-short} power supply, see its User Guide (see <<**s_Related-Documents>>**) for important information.**

*All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.*

========================================

[#s_Connecting-the-IZ-Panel]

=== Connecting the IZ Panel

The {hw-connection-panel} is used in connection cabinets. It provides a convenient way to connect the Power/LAN cable from the {shortprodname} camera to the LAN and power supply (see the {hw-connection-panel} documentation referred to in <<s_Related-Documents>>).

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

When using {compname-short} cables (such as the IZ Composite Cable) for LAN connectivity from the camera via the {hw-connection-panel}, the maximum cable length is 200 ft (61 m).

========================================

The screw terminal blocks of the {hw-connection-panel} are plugs. They can be removed for more convenient access when attaching flying leads (wires). Use a 0.08 in (2 mm) flat screwdriver to tighten the terminal screws.

* Power -With the power supply OFF:

** Connect the power supply's (V{plus}), GND and drain terminals to the appropriate connections on the {hw-connection-panel}'s smaller terminal block.

** Connect the camera Power/LAN cable's flying leads (wires) red ({plus}), black (-) and drain flying leads (wires) to the {hw-connection-panel}'s larger terminal block.

* LAN

** Connect the LAN TX {plus}/- and RX {plus}/- leads to the appropriate connections on the {hw-connection-panel}'s larger terminal block.

** Connect your network switch to the RJ45 connector on the {hw-connection-panel}.


[#s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams]

=== Typical Wiring Diagrams

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({software-ALPR} computer and cameras).

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

== Recognizing Devices with {software-discovery}

[#s_Installing-and-Using-IZ-Discovery]

=== Installing and Using {software-discovery}

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If any device on your network is connected via wireless, {software-discovery} will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running {software-discovery} is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed.

========================================

. Download the {software-discovery} software components (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

. Run {software-discovery}

. When {software-discovery} first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run.

. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow.

. {software-discovery} will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see <<f_IZ-Discovery-Utility>>).

.. Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device's IP address parameters (see <<s_Changing-a-Device-s-IP-Address-and-Network-Settings>>).

.. Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process.

[#f_IZ-Discovery-Utility]

.{software-discovery} Utility

image::./UserGuide/image27.png[image,width=541,height=362]

. If {software-discovery} does not recognize a device:

** Press the device's reset button (if available)

** Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power

** Check the LAN cable connected between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable connected between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and try to run {software-discovery} again.

[NOTE]

========================================

The device's IP Address +++<u>+++cannot+++</u>+++ be set to 10.10.2.xx or 10.10.3.xx

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access a device using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages (see <<s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera>>link:#_Ref523153568[38]).

A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the device's web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using {software-discovery}.

If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible.

Be sure to define IP addresses for each camera in the Camera System, plus the IP address of the onboard computer. It is recommended to use sequential IP addresses; for example: 192.168.5.64, 65, 66

You can also log in to each camera's configuration application to change its IP address (see <<s_Configuring-a-Camera>>).

========================================

To change the device's mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address:

. Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it.

. The Network Settings window appears

. To change the mode:

.. Check or uncheck the DHCP box

.. Click Save

. To change the IP address:

.. Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network

.. Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box

.. Enter the network address parameters

.. Write down the new IP Address and click Save

. The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close {software-discovery}, and then reopen it.

. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (see <<s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera>>), and change the IP address (see <<s_Changing-a-Camera-s-IP-Address>>)

. Select the function you need from the links at the upper right:

** Click the Live View link to see what the camera is currently viewing. You can also use controls such as zoom and focus (see <<s_Calibrating-the-Cameras-Using-RoadView>>).

[NOTE]

========================================

When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). +
If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera's firmware.

The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with the following format:

rtsp://[username:password]@<Camera IP address>/cam0_0 +
where cam0_0 are camera-specific parameters (which in this case enable you to access the primary stream)

To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: +
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

========================================

** If you need to change the IP address of the camera or other configuration parameters, click the Admin link.

. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator credentials of root, IZpass12.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost.

[#s_Changing-a-Camera-s-IP-Address]

=== Changing a Camera's IP Address

[NOTE]

========================================

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages.

========================================

. In the Basic Setup group, click on IP Address:

[#f_Changing-the-Camera-s-IP-Address]

.Changing the Camera's IP Address

image::./UserGuide/image30.png[image,width=524,height=180]

. To change the IP address to a fixed one:

[NOTE]

========================================

The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering.

========================================

.. Click the Static radio button.

.. Enter the network address parameters (see <<t_IP-Address-Parameters>>). All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the {compname-short} {software-ALPR} computer.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

It is highly recommended to record the camera's IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera's parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring {compname-short} ALPR software.

========================================

=== Logging Out of the Camera

Close all windows, and the browser window.

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras]

== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Specifications>> and <<s_Planning-Your-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.
