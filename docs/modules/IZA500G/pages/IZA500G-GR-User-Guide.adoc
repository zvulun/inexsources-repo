[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 12-24 VDC at the Camera System

* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable (without a switch) should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements

* Vehicle types

* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)

* Recessed plates

* Desired pre- or post-capture in relation to ticket issue (for parking)

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) a|
Avoid having these items in the Field of View:

* Fences with patterns

* Barriers

* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates

* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)

* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System's front window

* Reflective surfaces too close to camera lens

* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms

* Dirt on front window (see <<s_Troubleshooting-and-Maintenance>>)

|Mounting a|
* Typically on wall/pole

* Additional construction if needed

Here are typical wiring diagrams for capturing license plate images. Note that the type and configuration of the power supply may be different than the one you are using at your site. See <<t_Wiring-Diagram-Legend-Bill-of-Materials>> for a legend/bill of materials.

[CAUTION]

========================================

KEEP THE TRIGGER WIRES ISOLATED. SHORTING THE TRIGGER WIRES MAY DAMAGE THE UNIT AND VOID THE WARRANTY.

========================================

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

*After mounting, remove the protective film from the front window of the Camera System.*

[#s_Connecting-the-Camera-System-Illuminator-Power-Supply-and-Network]

=== Connecting the Camera System, Illuminator, Power Supply and Network

See <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams>> for typical wiring diagrams.

[WARNING]

========================================

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

*If you are using an {compname-short} power supply, see its User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>) for important information.*

*IMPORTANT: All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.*

The Camera System is not compatible with some GigE switches; suggested switch type: 10/100 Mb

========================================

As an example, you can connect the {generic-camera-name}'s power cable to a surface-mounted power supply as follows:

* *Red* - {plus}24 VDC ({plus}V); *Black* - -24 VDC (-V); *Yellow* - ground (FG)

.Connecting the Camera System to a Surface-Mount Power Supply

image::./UserGuide/image20.png[image,width=271,height=169]

[NOTE]

========================================

If you are using a DIN rail-mount power supply, you will need to cut off the rings at the ends of the power connections, and attach pins in their place.

========================================

[#s_Connecting-the-AC-Electricity]

=== Connecting the AC Electricity

.Connecting a Surface-Mount Power Supply to the AC Electricity

image::./UserGuide/image21.png[image,width=388,height=242]

Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the unit ON.

When the power supply is connected to the AC electricity, its LED will light up.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If the power cable was lengthened, adjust the voltage and make sure that the Camera System receives exactly its rated voltage (see <<s_Specifications>>).

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

========================================

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({software-ALPR} computer and cameras).

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras]

== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera displays a color overview image, but it is also used to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Specifications>> and <<s_Planning-Your-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.

=== Cleaning the {generic-camera-name}

Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the Camera System. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the {generic-camera-name}'s front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window +++<u>+++gently+++</u>+++.
