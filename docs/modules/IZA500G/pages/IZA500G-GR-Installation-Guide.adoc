|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* *On power, network and data cables*
|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* *Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.*

* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver the required voltage at the Camera System

* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable (without a switch) should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements

* Vehicle types

* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)

* Recessed plates

* Desired pre- or post-capture in relation to ticket issue (for parking)

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) a|
Avoid having these items in the Field of View:

* Fences with patterns

* Barriers

* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates

* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)

* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System's front window

* Reflective surfaces too close to camera lens

* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms

* Dirt on front window (see <<s_Troubleshooting-and-Maintenance>>)

|Mounting a|
* Typically on wall/pole

* Additional construction if needed

[#s_Prepare-Cables]

== Prepare Cables

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The trigger wires have the same functions and colors as shown here, but the label on the cable may be worded differently.

When adding extensions to the built-in cables, be sure that there are stable/correct signal and power levels delivered to all components.

For installations that require network cabling: typically use CAT 5e/6 cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

[#s_Connecting-the-AC-Electricity]

=== Connecting the AC Electricity

[WARNING]

========================================

If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all components receive exactly their rated voltage.

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

========================================

Connect a plug to the **+++<u>+++L+++</u>+++**ive ({plus}V), **+++<u>+++N+++</u>+++**eutral (-V) and Ground (Shield) terminals of the power supply (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams>>).

Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON.

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

=== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({software-ALPR} computer and cameras).

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

=== Set Up IP

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

See the {software-discovery} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)
for instructions on how to change a

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras]

[#s_Aim-and-Calibrate]

== Aim and Calibrate

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Plan-Your-Site>>
and the {docproductname} User Guide - see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.

[#s_Determining-the-IP-Address-of-the-RoadView-Computer-with-IZ-Discovery]

[#s_Verify-System-Operation]

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal) tab - see the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide). See <<s_Related-Documents>>.

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence.
