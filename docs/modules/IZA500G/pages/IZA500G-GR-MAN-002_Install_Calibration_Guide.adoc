========================================

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({software-ALPR} computer and cameras).

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

== Recognizing Devices with {software-discovery}

[#s_Installing-and-Using-IZ-Discovery]

=== Installing and Using {software-discovery}

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If any device on your network is connected via wireless, {software-discovery} will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running {software-discovery} is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed.

========================================

. Download the {software-discovery} software components (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

. Run {software-discovery}

. When {software-discovery} first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run.

. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow.

. {software-discovery} will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see <<f_IZ-Discovery-Utility>>).

.. Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device's IP address parameters (see <<s_Changing-a-Device-s-IP-Address-and-Network-Settings>>).

.. Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process.

[#f_IZ-Discovery-Utility]

.{software-discovery} Utility

image::./UserGuide/image22.png[image,width=541,height=362]

. If {software-discovery} does not recognize a device:

** Press the device's reset button (if available)

** Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power

** Check the LAN cable connected between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable connected between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and try to run {software-discovery} again.

[#s_Changing-a-Device-s-IP-Address-and-Network-Settings]

=== Changing a Device's IP Address and Network Settings

[#f_Changing-Device-s-Network-Settings]

.Changing Device's Network Settings

image::./UserGuide/image23.png[image,width=227,height=230]

[NOTE]

========================================

The device's IP Address +++<u>+++cannot+++</u>+++ be set to 10.10.2.xx or 10.10.3.xx

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access a device using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages (see <<s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera>>).

A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the device's web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using {software-discovery}.

If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible.

Be sure to define IP addresses for each camera in the Camera System, plus the IP address of the onboard computer. It is recommended to use sequential IP addresses; for example: 192.168.5.64, 65, 66

You can also log in to each camera's configuration application to change its IP address (see <<s_Configuring-a-Camera>>).

========================================

To change the device's mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address:

. Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it.

. The Network Settings window appears

. To change the mode:

.. Check or uncheck the DHCP box

.. Click Save

. To change the IP address:

.. Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network

.. Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box

.. Enter the network address parameters

.. Write down the new IP Address and click Save

. The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close {software-discovery}, and then reopen it.

. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (see <<s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera>>), and change the IP address (see <<s_Changing-a-Camera-s-IP-Address>>)

[#s_Configuring-a-Camera]

== Configuring a Camera

[#s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera]

=== Logging In to the Camera

. To view the camera's home page (see <<f_Camera-s-Home-Page>>):

** Open MS Internet Explorer. Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field of the browser. +
Alternatively, you can add an IE Tab extension to Chrome at this https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd[link]. +
Enter the IP address of the camera into the address field of the browser.

[#f_Camera-s-Home-Page]

If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera's firmware.

The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with the following format:

rtsp://[username:password]@<Camera IP address>/cam0_0 +
where cam0_0 are camera-specific parameters (which in this case enable you to access the primary stream)

To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: +
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

========================================

** If you need to change the IP address of the camera or other configuration parameters, click the Admin link.

. When prompted for a login, use the Administrator credentials of root, IZpass12.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost.

========================================

[#s_Changing-a-Camera-s-IP-Address]

== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera displays a color overview image, but it is also used to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Specifications>> and <<s_Planning-Your-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.
