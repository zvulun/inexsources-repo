== Background
{software-ALPR} is advanced ALPR software that reads
license plates using sophisticated image recognition algorithms,
and creates LPR Events. {software-ALPR} sends LPR Event data
via HTTP or other protocols to other systems.

The {docproductname} system records Events for vehicles
that commit a traffic violation, which are not on a list of
authorized vehicles (White List).

This document describes how to
configure the {compname-short} {docproductname3} {docproductname} system.

== Configuring Parameters via the GUI and API

{software-ALPR} can be configured using both
a web-based GUI and an API. Some parameters can only be
configured/controlled
via the API,  others only via the GUI, and some
via both (see <<t_GUI-API-Control>>).
See the  API document for further details.

== Computer and Software Requirements
* Computer running with Windows 10 or later
* Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser

<<<

== Use {software-discovery}

The factory default IP address of the {hw-advanced-processor}
Data Processing Unit (DPU) is on the sticker on the device;
typically {ip-default-IZA-DPU}. If needed, use {software-discovery} to change its IP address
to one you have allocated in your network.

== Prepare to Aim and Calibrate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of
the capture line. (This is the position at
which the vehicle detector signals that the
vehicle is present.) Ensure that the camera
is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the
required capture distance.

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate
at the expected distance and height.

image::ROOT:SLN-PTL/RV-PTL-FIG-012_CalibrationTab.png[image,800]

. When you see a vehicle at a typical
capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it.

. It is recommended to use the view called
"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)".
You select this view by clicking on the right-most button
at the upper left of the
screen: image:RoadViewALPR:UserGuide/image38.png[image,30]

. Select a camera from the dropdown list

. The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical)
are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically.

. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date
and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera.

. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket's adjustment
hardware (see <<f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments>>).

.. *Pan*: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license
plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View.

.. *Tilt:* Adjust the Tilt so that the image
of every expected plate position
(depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars,
jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen
(from top to bottom).

.. *Roll*: Adjust the Roll so the license plate's
image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground
(not tilted to one side).
+
[#f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments]

.Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments

image::ROOT:RoadViewALPR/PanTiltRoll.png[image,width=311,height=186]

. When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary
tightening of the mounting screws.

. Define the Region of Interest (*ROI*) by dragging
on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region.
For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be
large enough to capture the region where plates
could be found in images.
+
[NOTE]

========================================

The following settings for the cameras are saved
separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest
that is different for each camera.

========================================
+
////
. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust
the view of the video until the width of the plate
is within the extent of the vertices, and
its plate image is clear and sharp.
(The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body,
do not need to be as sharp as the plate.)
+
[IMPORTANT]
========================================
There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button
and when you see the effect on the screen.
Be sure to wait until you see the change
on the screen before clicking the button again.
Clicking the button multiple times will cause you
to "overshoot" the desired zoom/focus.

As you adjust the zoom and focus,
you may need to reposition the camera in order to
get the image of the plate back to the desired position.
========================================
////

. Define the *Plate Width Min*: Events will only be created
for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal
to this parameter. Enter the desired value
in the *Plate Width Min* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging the
small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab
(expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads.
For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far
away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human.

. Define the *Plate Width Max*: Events will only be
created for plate reads whose width is less than or
equal to this parameter. Enter
the desired value in the *Plate Width Max* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging
the large circle on the horizontal line on the
Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to prevent false reads,
such as large numbers on trucks.

. *Direction (red arrow on video):* Not used

. When you have finished, click the *Save* button.
Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically,
which indicates that the {software-ALPR} recognition software
is running again with the updated parameters.

. When the correct position is achieved, make a final
tightening of the mounting hardware.

. Repeat these steps for other cameras.

Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab:

* If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the camera so that the each camera's field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate's images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible.

* If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the camera with a soft cloth and mild soap

//* If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of each camera.
