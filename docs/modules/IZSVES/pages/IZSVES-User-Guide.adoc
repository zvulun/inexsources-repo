[#s_Illuminator-Models]

=== Illuminator Models

The illuminator model codes are *{shortprodname}[1/2]-(IR/DR/CL/WL)-10/20/30/H40/60/H120*, where:

* After {shortprodname}:

* 1/2 - number of LEDs: 1=30, 2=60

* WVLN = Wavelength/type of LEDs:

** IR - Infrared

** DR - Deep Red

** CL - Cool White (4000K)

** WL - Warm White (3000K)

* 10/20/30/H40/60/H120 - LED beam angle, in degrees
(Notes: H40 = H40xV15; H120xV20-degree model available as
{shortprodname}2-IR-H120)

[#s_Matching-an-Illuminator-to-Your-Camera-System]

=== Matching an Illuminator to Your Camera System

[NOTE]

========================================

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the {compname-short} camera. See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s).

========================================

The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance rating of the camera being used, as follows:

* Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances

* More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

See the appropriate Camera Installation and Configuration Guide(s) for an explanation of the model number codes (effective distances, and wavelengths/beam angles).
//*_\{Add {camera-5G} or GR here –
//since new pinout should allow for a
//strobe trigger as in the Driver Face Capture solution –
//and fix in catalog as well\}_*

|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
a|
*Cable Lengths*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
Illuminator Cable: Use a cable length long enough to:

* Reach the illuminator from the Camera System

* Deliver 24 VDC at the illuminator

* Deliver the required strobe and RS485 signals at the illuminator

|Mounting a|
* Typically on gantry

* Additional construction may be needed

|===

* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where
vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare
into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however,
white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at
the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[#s_Mounting]

== Mounting and Aiming

[#s_Overall-Mounting-Considerations]

=== Overall Mounting Considerations

* Mounting hardware may be included in your package, or packed separately, depending on your site's requirements. See the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated camera(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

[#s_Aiming-the-Illuminator]

=== Aiming the Illuminator

See your Camera System's User Guide for details on how to adjust
the position of the camera to optimize license plate recognition.
As part of this process, you may need to adjust the tilt and/or pan
of the illuminator.

For instructions on how to adjust the pan and tilt,
see the Mounting Hardware documentation (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

[#s_Connecting-the-Camera-System-Illuminator-Power-Supply-and-Network]

== Connecting the Illuminator to the Camera System

[WARNING]

========================================

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

========================================

[IMPORTANT]

========================================
If you need to use a longer illuminator
cable
(see <<s_Additional-Installation-Considerations>>),
be sure that: the supplied voltage (24 VDC)
reaches the illuminator, the strobe signal
levels you need reach the illuminator,
and the RS485 signal levels reach the
illuminator.

All cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

== Configuration

[#s_Triggering-and-Pulse-Width]

=== Strobe Input and Pulse Width

The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project's requirements.

[#s_Configuring-Management-Software-to-Use-with-an-Illuminator]

=== Configuring Management Software to Use with an Illuminator

Use the {compname-short} Camera System's management software to configure illuminator-related parameters, such as when the illuminator will operate (only at night or all the time). See the management software's User Guide for further details.


[#s_Verifying-Infrared-type-Operation]

== Verifying Infrared-type Operation

You can see active infrared-type LEDs with certain model smartphone cameras to see if the LEDs are working.

== Maintenance

[#s_Checking-Mounting-Screws]

=== Checking Mounting Screws

It is recommended to check all mounting screws for proper tightness once every two years.

[#s_Cleaning-the-Illuminator]

=== Cleaning the Illuminator

[NOTE]

========================================

Always wipe the window +++<u>+++gently+++</u>+++.

========================================

Do not use solvents or strong abrasive detergent when cleaning the illuminator. Use a soft dry cloth to clean the front glass when it is dirty. If the dirt has hardened, remove it using mild soap and water, and then wipe the front window gently.
