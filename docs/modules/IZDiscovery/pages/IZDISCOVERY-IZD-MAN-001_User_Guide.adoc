[#s_Installing-and-Using-IZ-Discovery]

=== Installing and Using {software-discovery}
The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If any device on your network is connected via wireless, {software-discovery} will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running {software-discovery} is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed.

========================================

. Download the {software-discovery} software (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

. Run {software-discovery}

. When {software-discovery} first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run.

. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow.

. {software-discovery} will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see <<f_IZ-Discovery-Utility>>).

.. Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device's IP address parameters (see <<s_Changing-a-Device-s-IP-Address-and-Network-Settings>>).

.. Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process.

. If {software-discovery} does not recognize a device:

** Press the device's reset button (if available)

** Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power

** Check the LAN cable connected between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable connected between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and try to run {software-discovery} again.
