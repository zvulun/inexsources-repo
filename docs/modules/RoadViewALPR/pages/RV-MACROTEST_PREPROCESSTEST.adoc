[#s_System-Requirements]

== System Requirements

You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. +++<u>+++If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight+++</u>+++. Required software:

* Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in "Windows Features"

* Internet Explorer browser version 11 or higher, or the latest version of Chrome
+

[NOTE]

========================================

You can add an IE Tab extension to Chrome at this link (to enable access to the Flexwatch camera configuration application): +
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ie-tab/hehijbfgiekmjfkfjpbkbammjbdenadd

========================================

[#s_Quick-Overview-of-Steps]

== Quick Overview of Steps

* Reserve IP addresses for the components in your ALPR system - {shortprodname} computer(s) and camera(s) - see <<s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network>> .

* Use {software-discovery} to find the initial IP Addresses of the cameras connected to your network - see <<s_Determining-the-IP-Addresses-of-the-Connected-Cameras>> .

* Log into each camera, and change its IP address according to the requirements of your network. +++<u>+++Use fixed addresses+++</u>+++. Record these new addresses for use in {shortprodname} configuration. See <<s_Changing-the-IP-Addresses-of-the-Cameras>> .

Connect your laptop to the same network switch the computer running {shortprodname} is connected to.

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

=== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({shortprodname} computer and cameras).

[#s_Determining-the-IP-Addresses-of-the-Connected-Cameras]

=== Determining the IP Addresses of the Connected Cameras

See your camera's Installation Guide for an explanation of how to determine the initial IP addresses of cameras on your network (using {software-discovery}). You will need this information to log into the cameras, and to change the cameras' IP addresses.

[#s_Changing-the-IP-Addresses-of-the-Cameras]

=== Changing the IP Addresses of the Cameras

See your camera's Installation Guide for an explanation of how to log in to a camera, and how to edit its IP address (fixed addresses are highly recommended). Record the new addresses; you will need them to configure the {shortprodname} software.

[#s_Determining-the-IP-Address-of-the-RoadView-Computer-with-IZ-Discovery]

=== Determining the IP Address of the {shortprodname} Computer with {software-discovery}

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

[NOTE]

========================================

If any device on your network is connected via wireless, {software-discovery} will not recognize the device. In addition, if the computer running {software-discovery} is connected via wireless, you will not see any devices displayed.

========================================

. Download the {software-discovery} software (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

. Run {software-discovery}

. When {software-discovery} first runs, you may see a Windows security warning. If so, click Run.

. If you see a message related to the Windows firewall, click Allow.

. {software-discovery} will start and display a list of devices on the network, according to their serial numbers (see <<f_IZ-Discovery-Utility>>).

.. Scroll down to find the device you are interested in. You can double-click to view/edit a specific device's IP address parameters (see <<s_Changing-the-RoadView-Computer-s-IP-Address-and-Network-Settings>>).

.. Click Clear List to refresh the discovery process.
+
[#f_IZ-Discovery-Utility]

.{software-discovery} Utility

image::image2.PNG[image,width=503,height=337]

. If {software-discovery} does not recognize a device:

** Press the device's reset button (if available)

** Reset the device by shutting off power/removing the LAN cable, waiting 5 seconds, and reapplying power

** Check the LAN cable connected between your laptop and the network, and the LAN cable connected between the device and the LAN switch. Replace the cable(s) and try to run {software-discovery} again.

[NOTE]

========================================

The device's IP Address +++<u>+++cannot+++</u>+++ be set to 10.10.2.xx or 10.10.3.xx

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages

A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using {software-discovery}.

If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible.

========================================

To change the device's mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address:

. Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it.

. The Network Settings window appears

. To change the mode:

.. Check or uncheck the DHCP box

.. Click Save

. To change the IP address:

.. Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network

.. Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box

.. Enter the network address parameters

.. Write down the new IP Address and click Save

. The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close {software-discovery}, and then reopen it.

. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (see <<s_Logging-In-and-Logging-Out>>) and change the IP address.

========================================

{shortprodname} can send Events via HTTP, and act as both a ZAP Server and ZAP Client - all simultaneously.

========================================

* *ZAP Server* - Check the box to have {shortprodname} act as a ZAP Server, to which ZAP Clients can connect (see the ZAP Protocol document for details):

** *Ports* - Each Lane configured in {shortprodname} will automatically have its own row in the table. Each Lane should have a different port number.

** *ZAP Version* - ZAP communication protocol version. It is recommended to use version 4.4. The connected clients must use the same version.

** *Confidence Filter* - the confidence level below which Events are not sent

** *Keep Time (seconds)* - how long a Capture message is to be left in memory before it will be deleted (if a Keep message is not received)

** *Offline Enabled* - check this box to enable the ZAP offline queue

** *FTP Enabled (for ZAP Server) -* when a client is connected to {shortprodname} via ZAP, images can be sent to the client via FTP if this checkbox is checked.

*** +++<u>+++FTP Server+++</u>+++ - the IP address of the FTP server

*** +++<u>+++FTP Port+++</u>+++ - the port on the FTP server listening for FTP messages

*** +++<u>+++FTP Folder+++</u>+++ - the folder path on the FTP server where the images will be stored

*** +++<u>+++FTP User+++</u>+++ - the username used to access the FTP server

*** +++<u>+++FTP Password+++</u>+++ - the password used to access the FTP server

*** +++<u>+++FTP Keep Alive Rate (seconds)+++</u>+++ - time (in seconds) between attempts to check that the connection with the FTP server is still alive

* *ZAP Client* - Check the box to have {shortprodname} act as a ZAP Client, which will connect to a ZAP Server (see the ZAP Protocol document for details). +
 +
If you want {shortprodname} to work with IZCentral, {shortprodname} can only be working as a ZAP Client. In this mode, the {shortprodname} ZAP Client port must match the IZCentral ZAP port (see the IZCentral documentation - see <<s_Related-Documents>>)

** *IP* - The IP address of the ZAP Server (to which {shortprodname} acting as a client should connect)

** *Port* - The port number of the ZAP Server

** *ZAP Version* - ZAP communication protocol version. It is recommended to use version 4.4. The server being connected to must use the same version.

** *Confidence Filter* - the confidence level below which Events are not sent

** *Keep Time (seconds)* - how long a Capture message is to be left in memory before it will be deleted (if a Keep message is not received)

** *Offline Enabled* - check this box to enable the ZAP offline queue

** *FTP Enabled (for ZAP Client) -* when {shortprodname} is connected to a ZAP server, images can be sent to the server via FTP if this checkbox is checked. (See the FTP Server items for the definition of the additional FTP parameters.)

* Remember to click the Save button under the Detection Configuration section after changing these parameters.

[#s_Calibration-Tab]

== Calibration Tab

[#f_Calibration-Tab]

.Calibration Tab

image::image7.png[image,width=624,height=313]

. When you see a vehicle at a typical capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it.

. It is recommended to use the view called "Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)". You select this view by clicking on the right-most button at the upper left of the screen: image:image8.png[image,width=21,height=15]

. Select a camera from the dropdown list (LPR or OV).

. The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical) are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically according to the Camera's hardware configuration. See your Camera's Installation and Calibration Guide.

. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera.

. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket's adjustment hardware (see <<f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments>>).

.. *Pan*: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View.

.. *Tilt:* Adjust the Tilt so that the image of every expected plate position (depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars, jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen (from top to bottom).

.. *Roll*: Adjust the Roll so the license plate's image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground (not tilted to one side).
+
[#f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments]

.Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments

image::image9.png[image,width=311,height=186]

. When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary tightening of the mounting screws.

. Define the Region of Interest (*ROI*) by dragging on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region. For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be large enough to capture the region where plates could be found in images.
+
[NOTE]

========================================

The following settings for the LPR and OV cameras are saved separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest that is different for each camera.

========================================

. Define the *Plate Width Min*: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal to this parameter. It is recommended to enter 150 in the *Plate Width Min* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging the small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads. For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human.

. Define the *Plate Width Max*: Events will only be created for plate reads whose width is less than or equal to this parameter. It is recommended to enter approximately 350 in the *Plate Width Max* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging the large circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to prevent false reads, such as large numbers on trucks.

. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust the view of the video until the width of the plate is 150 pixels, and its plate image is clear and sharp. (The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body, do not need to be as sharp as the plate.)
+
[NOTE]

========================================

There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button and when you see the effect on the screen. Be sure to wait until you see the change on the screen before clicking the button again. Clicking the button multiple times will cause you to "overshoot" the desired zoom/focus.

As you adjust the zoom and focus, you may need to reposition the camera in order to get the image of the plate back to the desired position.

========================================

. *Direction (red arrow on video):* drag the head of the arrow around to point to the angle at which you expect vehicles to be moving**.** (The vehicle's direction is also sent to the {software-cloud} as part of an Event.) You can add a Direction column to the Live tab using the multi-line menu at the upper right of the screen. +
You can set the "Ignore Opposite Direction" parameter in the Lanes section to ignore all Events for vehicles moving in the direction opposite to the direction arrow in the Calibration tab

. When you have finished, click the *Save* button. Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically, which indicates that the {shortprodname} recognition software is running again with the updated parameters.

. When the correct position is achieved, make a final tightening of the mounting hardware.

. Repeat these steps for the other camera.

The Live tab and Search tab are empty (no Events are detected) a|
* Verify that each camera's IP address in the Camera System (or connected to the DPU), and the {shortprodname} computer's IP address are all on the same subnet.

* Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load.

* Verify that the IP address(es) configured in {shortprodname} match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s)..

|Recognition rates are low a|
* On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence

* On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max

Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab:

* If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the Camera so that the Camera's field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate's images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible.

* If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the Camera System with a soft cloth and mild soap

* If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of the camera
