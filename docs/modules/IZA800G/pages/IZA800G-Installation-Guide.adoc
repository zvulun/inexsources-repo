|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System

* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

* In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, the outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements

* Vehicle types

* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)

* Recessed plates

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) a|
Avoid having these items in the Field of View:

* Fences with patterns

* Barriers

* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates

* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)

* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System's front window

* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms

* Dirt on front window

|Mounting a|
* Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole)

* Additional construction if needed

See <<f_Typical-Camera-System-with-Illuminator-Wiring-Diagram>> and <<f_Typical-Camera-System-Wiring-Diagram>> for typical wiring diagrams.

[WARNING]

========================================

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

Turn off/disconnect the external (AC) power supply before connecting cables.

*If you are using an {compname-short} power supply, see its User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>) for important information.*

*IMPORTANT: All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.*

The Camera System is not compatible with some GigE switches; suggested switch type: 10/100 Mb

The torques required to connect the cable connectors to the connectors on the Camera System are as follows: +
Power/signals cable: 3-4 kgf.cm / 0.29-0.39 N.m. +
LAN cable: 5-8 kgf.cm / 0.49-0.78 N.m.

Connect a plug to the **+++<u>+++L+++</u>+++**ive, **+++<u>+++N+++</u>+++**eutral and Ground terminals of the power supply (see <<f_Typical-Camera-System-with-Illuminator-Wiring-Diagram>> and <<f_Typical-Camera-System-Wiring-Diagram>>).

Plug the power supply into the AC electricity. If required, switch the power supply unit ON.

[WARNING]

========================================

If any power cables were lengthened, ensure that all components receive exactly their rated voltage.

Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

[#s_Reserving-IP-Addresses-in-your-Network]

=== Reserving IP Addresses in your Network

The {compname-short} cameras have been pre-configured with default IP addresses. You will probably need to change these addresses to conform to the requirements of your network. Be sure that you have IP addresses reserved for all components of your ALPR system ({software-ALPR} computer and cameras).

[#s_Recognizing-Devices-with-IZ-Discovery]

=== Set Up IP

The {software-discovery} utility discovers all active devices connected to the network, and displays a list of their network parameters. These devices can include cameras and computers.

See the {software-discovery} User Guide (see <<s_Related-Documents>>)
for instructions on how to change a

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras]

[#s_Aim-and-Calibrate]

== Aim and Calibrate

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Plan-Your-Site>>
and the {shortprodname} User Guide - see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal) tab - see the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide). See <<s_Related-Documents>>.

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence.
