* Tools for building LAN cables (wire stripper, crimp tool, etc.) and RJ45 connectors with metal bodies.
+
[IMPORTANT]

========================================

All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

========================================

* You will need to provide a laptop computer to use for configuration. If you will be using the laptop outdoors, the screen must be able to be seen in strong sunlight. Required software:

** Windows 10 or above - with .NET 4.5 enabled in "Windows Features"

** Internet Explorer browser version 11 or higher. +

* External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System's supply.

** Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

** Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[#s_Planning-Your-Installation]

== Planning Your Installation

[#s_Horizontal-Field-of-View-Capture-Line]

=== Horizontal Field of View (Capture Line)

Your Camera System's Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can "see". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or "capture line".

See <<s_Specifications>> for the horizontal and vertical FOV specifications.

[#f_Field-of-View-Capture-Line]

.Field of View (Capture Line)

image::./UserGuide/image10.png[image,width=634,height=194]

Select your Camera System's position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the Camera System facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams:

[#f_Plates-Within-Capture-Line]

.Plates Within Capture Line

[#f_Plates-Parallel-to-Capture-Line-Away-from-Road-Curves]

.Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves

image::./UserGuide/image12.png[image,width=503,height=314]

[#s_Angles-and-Distances]

=== Angles and Distances

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified.

========================================

[#f_Horizontal-Camera-Angle-Pan-Angle]

.Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle)

image::./UserGuide/image13.png[image,width=310,height=332]

[NOTE]

========================================

The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line).

If you must capture plates on a curve, place the Camera System on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle.

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle.

========================================

[#f_Vertical-Camera-Angle-Tilt-Angle-and-Line-of-Sight-Distance-from-Plate]

.Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate

image::./UserGuide/image14.png[image,width=626,height=194]

[NOTE]

========================================

The distance from the Camera System to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera.

Adjust the vertical angle so that the Camera System can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road.

The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°.

Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic).

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the vehicle.

========================================

[#s_Position-of-the-Sun-in-Relation-to-the-Camera-System]

=== Position of the Sun in Relation to the Camera System

The Camera System should +++<u>+++not+++</u>+++ be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the Camera System shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate's characters.

Avoid/mitigate by:

* Not installing the Camera System in an east/west direction

* Installing the Camera System near a building that shields it from the sun's rays

* Installing the Camera System on a short pole

* Using a double-Camera System installation (2 different angles or front/rear)

[#s_Matching-Your-Camera-System-to-an-INEX-Illuminator]

==== Matching Your Camera System to an {compname-short} Illuminator

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the {compname-short} Camera System. See the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s) for compatibility information (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

========================================

*The {compname-short} {shortprodname} Camera System is typically used with the {illum-strobe} series strobe illuminators.*

By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator you need to the {compname-short} Camera System being used.

* The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows:

** Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances

** More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s)

[#s_Illuminator-Triggering-and-Pulse-Width]

==== Illuminator Triggering and Pulse Width

You can trigger an illuminator from the OV camera by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams>>). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project's requirements.

[#s_Illuminator-Mounting-and-Aiming]

==== Illuminator Mounting and Aiming

**See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see <<**s_Related-Documents>>**).**

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|* On power, network and data cables
|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.

* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

*IMPORTANT* +
+++<u>+++All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.+++</u>+++

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System

* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).

* In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, the outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements

* Vehicle types

* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)

* Recessed plates

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) a|
Avoid having these items in the Field of View:

* Fences with patterns

* Barriers

* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates

* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)

* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System's front window

* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms

* Dirt on front window (see <<s_Troubleshooting-and-Maintenance>>)

|Mounting a|
* Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole)

* Additional construction if needed

=== Constructing the Power/Signals Cable

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the Camera System.

========================================

Use the cable type recommended in the Required Accessories section (see <<s_Required-Accessories>>).

. Prepare the cable shielding:

.. Thread the cable all the way through the clamp cage body. Strip off the outer insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires exposed to a length of 18mm. *Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

.. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation.

.. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires.

.. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) 1-2 times around the foil jacket that you bent back.

. The point in the cable at which you will be connecting the power wires ({plus}, - and ground) to the power supply may be in the middle of the cable. (This part of the cable is typically inside a connection box to seal all connections from moisture.)

.. Strip off a portion of outer insulation of the cable at the end you will be connecting to the power supply. Remove enough insulation so the shield wire will be long enough to wrap several times around the foil jacket (see next steps) and come out of the cable to reach the power supply ground wire. *Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

.. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Leave enough foil exposed so the shield wire can be wrapped several times around the foil.

.. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires.

.. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) several times around the foil jacket that you bent back. There must be a tight contact between the shield wire and the foil.

[#s_Constructing-the-LAN-Cable]

=== Constructing the LAN Cable

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable's shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures).

The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable.
