[#s_Matching-Your-Camera-System-to-an-INEX-Illuminator]

==== Matching Your Camera System to an {compname-short} Illuminator

[IMPORTANT]

========================================

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the {compname-short} Camera System. See the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s) for compatibility information (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).

========================================

*The {compname-short} {shortprodname} Camera System is typically used with the {illum-strobe} series strobe illuminators.*

By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator you need to the {compname-short} Camera System being used.

* The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows:

** Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances

** More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s)

[#s_Illuminator-Triggering-and-Pulse-Width]

==== Illuminator Triggering and Pulse Width

You can trigger an illuminator from the OV camera by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagrams>>). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project's requirements.

[#s_Illuminator-Mounting-and-Aiming]

==== Illuminator Mounting and Aiming

**See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations (see <<**s_Related-Documents>>**).**

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact {compname-short} for guidance/training about this subject.

* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras]

== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Specifications>> and <<s_Planning-Your-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.
