Note how you do not need a backslash in front of curly brackets
From Dan Allen: It's because {here is some text} is not a valid attribute reference (because of the spaces), so there is no need to escape it. You only need to escape what would be interpreted.
However, for \{TBD\}, backslashes are required since there are no spaces in TBD and it will
be interpreted as an attribute
