== Introduction
This is an IZA800G gigantic introduction

== Installation
Here is an include from the partial of the installation intro that is in this same IZA800G /partials folder; note how by defining the productname variable (with a colon before and after) with the product name of this page, you will see it in the partial which uses the same variable name in curly brackets:
include::partial$prtl-install-intro.adoc[]
