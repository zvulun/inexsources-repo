* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

== Planning Your Installation[#ps_Plan-Installation]

*_\{Zvulun: entire section is a possible partial}_*

=== Horizontal Field of View (Capture Line)

Your Camera System's Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can "see". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or "capture line".

____
.Field of View (Capture Line)
____

image::image10.png[image,width=634,height=194]

One of the specifications of your Camera System (see <<t_Technical-Specifications>>) is the sensor resolution width, in pixels.

Another important specification is the number of pixels needed to recognize a license plate. For example, this is typically \{recognitionpixels} for a U.S. plate image captured at the middle of the capture line.

The factor determining the number of plate widths that can fit in the camera sensor's Field of View is the resolution width divided by the plate pixels. For a Camera System with a resolution width of \{resolutionwidth} pixels, this would be \{resolutionwidth}/\{recognitionpixels} = \{FOVplatewidths}

Multiplying this factor by the width of a plate in your location will give you the length of the capture line. For a U.S. plate \{platewidthfeet} foot wide, the width of the capture line will be approximately \{capturelinefeet} feet (\{capturelinemeters} meters).

Select your Camera System's position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the Camera System facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams:

____
.Plates Within Capture Line

image::image11.png[image,width=247,height=411]
____

.Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves

image::image12.png[image,width=503,height=314]

=== Angles and Distances

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified.

____
.Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle)

image::image13.png[image,width=310,height=332]
____

[Note]
===================================
The maximum horizontal angle allowed is *_\{Zvulun: be sure degree symbol shows up in Asciidoc}_* 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line).

If you must capture plates on a curve, place the Camera System on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle.

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the car.

====================================

.Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate
image::image14.png[image,width=626,height=194]

[Note]
========================================
The distance from the Camera System to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera.

Adjust the vertical angle so that the Camera System can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road.

The maximum vertical angle allowed is *_\{Zvulun: be sure degree symbol shows up in asciidoc}_* 30°.

Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic).

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the car.

========================================

=== Position of the Sun in Relation to the Camera System

The Camera System should +++not+++ be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the Camera System shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate's characters.

Avoid/mitigate by:

* Not installing the Camera System in an east/west direction
* Installing the Camera System near a building that shields it from the sun's rays
* Installing the Camera System on a short pole
* Using a double-Camera System installation (2 different angles or front/rear)

==== Matching Your Camera System to an INEX Illuminator

*_\{Zvulun: the following important note could be a partial - but so small so may not be worth it?}_*

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the INEX Camera System. See the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s) for compatibility information.

*The INEX \{shortprodname} Camera Systems are typically used with the _\{Zvulun: needs link - get from related docs table}_ IZS series strobe illuminators.*

By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator you need to the INEX Camera System being used.

* Infrared-type illuminators are typically synchronized with the LPR sensor, and white illuminators are typically synchronized with the OV sensor. You can choose which sensor to trigger from (LPR or OV) by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagram>>).
* The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows:
* Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances
* More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s)

==== Illuminator Triggering and Pulse Width

You can choose which camera to trigger from (LPR or OV) by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagram>>). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project's requirements.

==== Illuminator Mounting and Aiming

*_\{Zvulun: partial called p-optional_acces_illum.adoc}_*

*See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations.*

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact INEX for guidance/training about this subject.
* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

==== Verifying Infrared-type Illuminator Operation

You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working.

=== Constructing the Power/Signals Cable[#ps_Construct-Pwr-Signals-Cable]

*_\{Zvulun: possible partial section}_*

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the camera.

Use the cable type recommended in the Required Accessories section (see <<s_Required-Accessories>>).

Lay out the parts from the power connector package.

Using a 16 mm wrench, tighten the nut that seals the end of the clamp cage housing. (torque 4-6 kgf.cm / 0.39-0.59 N.m.). Verify that the sealing nut is in tight contact with the inner body of the nut (to provide insulation against moisture). The sealing nut may pucker a bit due to the pressure of the nut; this is normal.

.Power Cable: Tightening the Nut to Seal the Clamp Cage

____
image::image28.png[image,width=445,height=201]
____

The point in the cable at which you will be connecting the power wires (+, - and ground) to the power supply may be in the middle of the cable. (This part of the cable is typically inside a connection box to seal all connections from moisture.)

Strip off a portion of outer insulation of the cable at the end you will be connecting to the power supply. Remove enough insulation so the shield wire will be long enough to wrap several times around the foil sheath (see next steps) and come out of the cable to reach the power supply ground wire. *Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic sheaths (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

Slit the foil sheath, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Leave enough foil exposed so the shield wire can be wrapped several times around the foil.

Carefully cut away the plastic sheath enclosing the individual insulated wires.

Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) several times around the foil sheath that you bent back. There must be a tight contact between the shield wire and the foil.

.Power Cable: Wrapping the Shield Wire at Power Supply End

____
image::image29.png[image,width=478,height=194]
____

IMPORTANT: Check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the camera.

You can seal the shield wire wrapping on the cable with insulation tape or heat shrink tubing.

Connect the shield wire to the ground wire of the power supply. You may need to extend the shield wire by soldering an additional wire on to it.

Connect the (+) and (-) wires from the cable to the power supply.

{empty}[#s_Construct-LAN-Cable]

=== Constructing the LAN Cable

*_\{Zvulun: possible partial section}_*

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

=========================================

If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable's shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures).

The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable.

The device's IP Address +++cannot+++ be set to 10.10.2.xx or 10.10.3.xx

*+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access a device using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages (see <<ps_Logging-In-to-Camera>>).

A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the device's web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using IZ Discovery.

If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible.

====================================

To change the device's mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address:

Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it.

The Network Settings window appears

To change the mode:

Check or uncheck the DHCP box

Click Save

To change the IP address:

Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box

Enter the network address parameters

Write down the new IP Address and click Save

The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close IZ Discovery, and then reopen it.

Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (see <<ps_Logging-In-to-Camera>>), and change the IP address (see <<ps_Changing-Camera-IP>>)

____
{empty}[Note]

=====================================

When using Live View for the first time, you may be prompted to download and install an ActiveX control (Smart Viewer). +
If you do not have an internet connection to the network on which the camera is installed, wait 30 seconds, and you will be instructed on how to install the ActiveX control locally via the camera's firmware.

The stream of the Live View can also be accessed using an RTSP URL with the following format: *_\{Zvulun: be sure the at sign shows up in ascii doc}_*

rtsp://[username:password]@<Camera IP address>/cam0_0 +
where cam0_0 are camera-specific parameters (which in this case enable you to access the primary stream)

To see the stream, use a video player such as the VLC player, located at: +
https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

=====================================
____

* If you need to change the IP address of the camera or other configuration parameters, click the Admin link.
+
When prompted for a login, use the Administrator credentials of root, IZpass12.

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

The Administrator user name (root) cannot be changed, and the Administrator password is encrypted. Therefore, if someone changes the Administrator password, there is no way to find out the password if it gets lost.

To change the IP address to a fixed one:

{empty}[Note]

The IP address must be unique within the entire ALPR system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering.

Click the Static radio button.

Enter the network address parameters (see <<pt_IP-Address-Parameters>>). *All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the INEX RoadView computer.*

{empty}[IMPORTANT]

It is highly recommended to record the camera's IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera's parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring INEX ALPR software.

After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. +
- If you click the browser's Back button, all values will be discarded. +
- If you click the browser's Refresh button, the application will load the previous values.

===================================

In the IZ Discovery utility (see <<ps_Recognize-IZ-Discovery>>), click the "Clear List" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address.

=== Logging Out of the Camera

Close all windows, and the browser window.

{empty}[#s_Calibrating-Cameras]

== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the camera is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Built-in-White-LEDs-IZA800GW >> and <<ps_Plan-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.
