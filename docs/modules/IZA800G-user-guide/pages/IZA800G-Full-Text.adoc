=== Camera System Details and Dimensions

The {shortprodname} ALPR All-in-one AI Camera System is suitable for tolling and ITS applications, with different models available for different distances and illumination requirements. *_\{Zvulun: partial}_* It has a rugged, all-weather, IP67-compliant, waterproof housing and a protective sunshade. The system consists of a black and white License Plate Recognition (LPR) camera, a color Overview (OV) camera, and an integrated, LED-based illumination system. A computer running license plate recognition software is also built in.

*_\{Zvulun: front and side view of dimensions should be converted to partials}_*

=== Multi-flash Technology

*_\{Zvulun: possible partial, along with the picture}_* The Camera System's illuminators project different light intensities in a sequence (also called multi-flash technology). This produces a series of video frames with varying degrees of illumination, which helps to determine the best possible recognition.

=== Optional Accessories

*_\{Zvulun the last two bullets are a partial - p-optional_acces_illum.adoc - but you will need to be sure that the bullets are at the second level, plus you will need another of the same text but with bullets at the first level for other places in this document.}_*

* External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System's supply.
** Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact INEX for guidance/training about this subject.
** Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

[#ps_Plan-Installation]
== Planning Your Installation

*_\{Zvulun: entire section is a possible partial}_*

=== Horizontal Field of View (Capture Line)

Your Camera System's Field of View (FOV) is the area that the camera can "see". You can think of this area as an imaginary rectangle rising from the lane upwards. The width of this area is called the horizontal FOV or "capture line".


.Field of View (Capture Line)


image::image10.png[image,width=634,height=194]

One of the specifications of your Camera System (see <<t_Technical-Specifications>>) is the sensor resolution width, in pixels.

Another important specification is the number of pixels needed to recognize a license plate. For example, this is typically {recognitionpixels} for a U.S. plate image captured at the middle of the capture line.

The factor determining the number of plate widths that can fit in the camera sensor's Field of View is the resolution width divided by the plate pixels. For a Camera System with a resolution width of {resolutionwidth} pixels, this would be {resolutionwidth}/{recognitionpixels} = {FOVplatewidths}

Multiplying this factor by the width of a plate in your location will give you the length of the capture line. For a U.S. plate {platewidthfeet} foot wide, the width of the capture line will be approximately {capturelinefeet} feet ({capturelinemeters} meters).

Select your Camera System's position so that license plates are always within the capture line and parallel to it, with the Camera System facing as straight at the plates as possible - as shown in the following diagrams:


.Plates Within Capture Line

image::image11.png[image,width=247,height=411]


.Plates Parallel to Capture Line - Away from Road Curves

image::image12.png[image,width=503,height=314]

=== Angles and Distances

[IMPORTANT]
Installations that position the camera at significant angles in relation to the plates will reduce the line-of-sight distances specified.


.Horizontal Camera Angle (Pan Angle)

image::image13.png[image,width=310,height=332]


[NOTE]
====
The maximum horizontal angle allowed is 30° (to the farthest point at the end of the capture line).

If you must capture plates on a curve, place the Camera System on the side of the road that minimizes the horizontal angle.

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the car.
====

.Vertical Camera Angle (Tilt Angle) and Line-of-Sight Distance from Plate
image::image14.png[image,width=626,height=194]

[NOTE]
====
The distance from the Camera System to the capture line must be within the viewing range of the LPR camera.

Adjust the vertical angle so that the Camera System can read plates at all of their expected heights from the road.

The maximum vertical angle allowed is 30°.

Larger angles and/or greater mounting heights may be required in order to recognize plates on vehicles close to each other (such as in slow/congested traffic).

At larger angles, the reflectivity of the plates is reduced, resulting in images with less contrast.

For plates whose characters are very shiny (for example, silvery), the *weighted* angle must be less than 20 degrees. The weighted angle is the angle between a line from the camera to the plate, and a line running straight ahead from the car.
====

=== Position of the Sun in Relation to the Camera System

The Camera System should +++not+++ be positioned so that the rays of the sun behind the Camera System shine along the camera-to-plate axis. Reflective plates will cause severe glare to be reflected back to the camera, obscuring the image of the plate's characters.

Avoid/mitigate by:

* Not installing the Camera System in an east/west direction
* Installing the Camera System near a building that shields it from the sun's rays
* Installing the Camera System on a short pole
* Using a double-Camera System installation (2 different angles or front/rear)

=== Optimizing Nighttime Vehicle Overview Images (using External Illuminators)

*_\{Zvulun: possible partials in this section}_*

.External Illuminator

image::image16.png[image,width=136,height=121]

==== Matching Your Camera System to an INEX Illuminator

*_\{Zvulun: the following important note could be a partial - but so small so may not be worth it?}_*

[IMPORTANT]
The wavelength of an external illuminator must be compatible with the wavelength of the internal illuminators of the INEX Camera System. See the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s) for compatibility information.

*The INEX {shortprodname} Camera Systems are typically used with the xref:IZS-user-guide:IZS-S-MAN-002_Illuminator_User_Guide.adoc[IZS Series Strobe Illuminators,window=read-later].*

By using the following guidelines, you can match the illuminator you need to the INEX Camera System being used.

* Infrared-type illuminators are typically synchronized with the LPR sensor, and white illuminators are typically synchronized with the OV sensor. You can choose which sensor to trigger from (LPR or OV) by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagram>>).
* The number of illuminator LEDs and beam angle must match the distance type (long or short) of the Camera System being used, as follows:
** Fewer LEDs and wider beam angles are used for short distances
** More LEDs and narrower beam angles are used for longer distances

The results of applying these guidelines can be found in the appropriate Illuminator Series User Guide(s)

==== Illuminator Triggering and Pulse Width

You can choose which camera to trigger from (LPR or OV) by using appropriate wiring (see <<s_Typical-Wiring-Diagram>>). The pulse width and other parameters that affect illuminator operation are pre-configured according to your project's requirements.

==== Illuminator Mounting and Aiming

*_\{Zvulun: partial called p-optional_acces_illum.adoc}_*

*See the illuminator guides for further details about installation and mounting considerations.*

* Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact INEX for guidance/training about this subject.
* Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.

==== Verifying Infrared-type Illuminator Operation

You can look at an infrared-type illuminator with a smartphone camera to see if it is working.

=== Additional Installation Considerations

*_\{Zvulun: many parts of this table are possible partials}_*

.Additional Installation Considerations

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Item |Considerations
|*Surge Protection* a|
* *On power, network and data cables*

|*Correct, Stable and Sufficient Power* a|
* *Power undervoltage, overvoltage and/or incorrect polarity will damage the unit and will void the warranty.*
* Stable power at the correct level must be supplied to each Camera System, even when under a heavy processing load.

a|
*Cable Extensions*

[IMPORTANT]
All network cable extensions and repeaters must be shielded.

a|
* Power - Use a cable gauge sufficient to deliver 24 VDC at the Camera System
* LAN - Use only CAT 5e/6 cable for any extensions added to the LAN cable. The total length of the cable should not exceed 328 feet (100 meters).
* In order to use the connector included with the Camera System, the outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

|Front/Rear Capture - or Both a|
* Country requirements
* Vehicle types
* Protruding parts that obscure plates (such as rear hooks)
* Recessed plates

|Objects with character-like appearances (interpreted as characters on a plate, resulting in false reads) a|
Avoid having these items in the Field of View:

* Fences with patterns
* Barriers
* Signs

|Obstructions (blocking FOV) a|
* Entry gates
* Trees and bushes (even before fully grown)
* Bright light (sun/artificial) shining directly into Camera System's front window
* Weather - snow, heavy rain, dust storms
* Dirt on front window (see <<s_Troubleshooting-and-Maintenance>>)

|Mounting a|
* Typically gantry (can also be on wall/pole)
* Additional construction if needed

.. Slit the foil sheath, and bend it back onto the outer insulation.

.. Carefully cut away the plastic sheath enclosing the individual insulated wires.

.. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) 1-2 times around the foil sheath that you bent back.

. The point in the cable at which you will be connecting the power wires (+, - and ground) to the power supply may be in the middle of the cable. (This part of the cable is typically inside a connection box to seal all connections from moisture.)

.. Strip off a portion of outer insulation of the cable at the end you will be connecting to the power supply. Remove enough insulation so the shield wire will be long enough to wrap several times around the foil sheath (see next steps) and come out of the cable to reach the power supply ground wire. *Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic sheaths (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

.. Slit the foil sheath, and bend it back onto the outer insulation. Leave enough foil exposed so the shield wire can be wrapped several times around the foil.

.. Carefully cut away the plastic sheath enclosing the individual insulated wires.

.. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) several times around the foil sheath that you bent back. There must be a tight contact between the shield wire and the foil.

[#ps_Construct-LAN-Cable]
=== Constructing the LAN Cable

*_\{Zvulun: possible partial section}_*

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable's shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures).

The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable.

[#s_Calibrating-Cameras]
== Calibrating the Cameras

There are two cameras in the Camera System. Both are calibrated in nearly the same way. The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white, and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image, and to perform LPR recognition. You may even be able to improve read accuracy by changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer than the other one.

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of the capture line. (This is the position at which the vehicle sensor signals that the vehicle is present.) Ensure that the camera is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the required capture distance (see <<s_Built-in-White-LEDs-IZA800GW>> and <<ps_Plan-Installation>>).

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate at the expected distance and height.
