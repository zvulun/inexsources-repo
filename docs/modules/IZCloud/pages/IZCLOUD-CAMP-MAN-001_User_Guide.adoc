it throws an error}_*

== Importing a List of Plates
*_/{What does the "send activation
email" check box do in the import
dialog;  why is the dialog called
ListPlateOwnerImportSettings?
This gives the impression I am importing the owner of
the list, not the owners of the vehicles}_*

*_/{The import/export button has no export -
only import, and a link to an Excel template for
importing visitors}_*

*_/{fields not shown in the screen shot are:
UserName, Email Address, Password, Should Change
Password {means what?} (True/False), Active (True/False)}_*

at the upper right opens a menu to help
manage the user's account. My Settings (or
clicking the person icon on the banner)
enables you to change the user name; however
if you select Change Password and cancel,
the application will crash; F5 to refresh
seems to recover}_*
