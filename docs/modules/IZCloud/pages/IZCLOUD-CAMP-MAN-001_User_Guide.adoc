|Term |Explanation
|ALPR |Automatic License Plate Recognition
|IZ ALPR system |An Automatic License Plate Recognition system utilizing cameras and {shortprodname} software. The IZ ALPR system can capture LPR Events, and transmit them to other systems such as {software-server}.
|LPR Event |The identified occurrence of a passing vehicle by the IZ ALPR System. An LPR Event includes metadata (location, lane identifiers, timestamp, the identified license plate number, recognition confidence, and more), plus a set of related images; typically, an Overview image, an LPR camera image and an image of the license plate. Also called a Vehicle Event or Event. An Event may include images from more than one camera in the same Lane.

can set the car limit
If more than car limit is attempted,
cars over limit cannot come in; but
after 72 hrs (to make sure we didn't

then an additional car can enter.

a custom site URL and will get
username and password from INEX}_*

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Plate-Detail.png[image,width=800]



click on man item at right to
add to a list

How to search for a plate or a name
put in a letter which becomes a wildcard
for that letter in any position of the
plate characters

You can ask INEX to add different columns
such as the name of the vehicle owner, etc.

Date:
Click on date range to get a date popup
click on initial date, then on
final date. Check box to enable filter.

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Calendar-Popup.png[image,width=800]

Enable refresh - disable if you have a lot
of events, and you are trying to find one/filter

Filter by Gate - use dropdown.

Event Type or Type will not be on most users,
shows what list car was on.

Matched Plate - shows a match to a plate on a list
Plate Read and Matched Plate can be 2 characters off

Grant - Allowed in, gate opened

Deny - Access denied, gate not opened

There will be more actions in the future.

Plates should not be on multiple lists
but if they are, only one list will show
in the EventType column, and the "man" icon
will not be shown since plate is on a list.

There is an option INEX can add - Name of owner

Export to Excel button - be sure to select and check
a time range of a week or less, export will also
take all filters into account (such as only Vendors)

Alarms will display all vehicles that attempted entry
that are not on a list. When such a vehicle comes in
there will be a popup anywhere on the site, and
user will have to go to the Alarm screen to see a list of
all of them.
*_/{get screen shot from Erick}_*

Alarms will be disabled by default - ask INEX if you want them

== Viewing Live Video (Gates) and Opening a Gate in an Emergency

Coordinate with {compname-short} support
to set up access to your site's cameras
to enable a live video feed on this Gates page.

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Gates.png[image,width=800]

* Correct Plate Read: Enables correction of LPR read of
the last vehicle that passed through the gate

* Emergency Open: Press button, get are you sure,
then gate opens; for ambulance, police etc.

* Add to List: only active if plate is not already
on a list

* Add to Reservation: enables manually adding
car to an imported reservation. Comes from
a campground reservation site.
demo site does not have this menu item
but it will be there.


== Adding a List (Support Team Request)
Call or email the {compname-short} support team

Watch Lists is a list of all the lists.

A list can be created to NOT open the gate,
but still have the plates on that list
appear in the Events.

List could also be one for which Alerts
will popup (or only for an unknown vehicle as
it is on only one site now.)

== Adding New People to a List
Multiple plates can be separated by commas

Lists are of main people
Sub-lists are tied to one particular person,
such as guests for a resident


*_/{Not all buttons in the GUI have tooltips;
furthermore, some say edit OWNER/delete OWNER -
Why was the term OWNER used?}_*

*_/{The manage visitors button doesn't work
it throws an error}_*

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-List-Vendors.png[image,width=800]

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Edit-List-Item.png[image,width=800]

== Importing a List of Plates

*_/{What does the "send activation
email" check box do in the import
dialog;  why is the dialog called
ListPlateOwnerImportSettings?
This gives the impression I am importing the owner of
the list, not the owners of the vehicles}_*

*_/{The import/export button has no export -
only import, and a link to an Excel template for
importing visitors}_*

*_/{fields not shown in the screen shot are:
UserName, Email Address, Password, Should Change
Password {means what?} (True/False), Active (True/False)}_*

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Import-Template.png[image,width=800]

== Exporting a List of Plates
Via the export button from the Events screen

== Viewing the Dashboard
*_/{need this - it was suggested by Pinchas? or just
refer to Troubleshooting section?}_*

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Maintentance-Dashboard.png[image,width=800]

== Changing Username and Password

*_/{Clicking on the letter of the login name
at the upper right opens a menu to help
manage the user's account. My Settings (or
clicking the person icon on the banner)
enables you to change the user name; however
if you select Change Password and cancel,
the application will crash; F5 to refresh
seems to recover}_*

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-My-Settings.png[image,width=800]

image::IZCloud:IZCLOUD-CAMP-Change-Password.png[image,width=800]

== Troubleshooting
Note that the maintenance screen
is good for seeing if the DPU is online
It does not indicate anything about
if the camera is online, or health of the camera
(we are using IZ600Fs with DPUs)

Review Results in dropdown at side of camera entry
should show all of the events seen by that
camera but it is not working.
