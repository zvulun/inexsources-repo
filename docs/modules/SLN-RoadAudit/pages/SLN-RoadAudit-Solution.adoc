== Executive Summary

{shortprodname} uses the same technology
as {compname-short} {software-ALPR} software
to provide a portable, versatile audit
tool for end users and consultants.
Hardware (separate from the production
system) is installed at target locations,
and vehicle metrics of each transaction
are logged. Production transaction data metrics
such as axle count, automatic vehicle classification (AVC) class, and LPR
are matched with {shortprodname} transaction data. This can be
done in real time, or during post-process.

{shortprodname} tools rapidly display mismatched
transactions which are manually reviewed for disposition recording.
Basic reports can be output in CSV format, and
further analyzed by the client. {shortprodname}
can be moved from lane to lane or plaza to plaza,
depending on audit needs.

== Key Features and Benefits
* [*] Higher quality reviews with significantly less human labor

* [*] Not connected with existing production sensors,
providing true independent results

* [*] Eliminates contamination of data caused by other data logger
audit tools that use production sensors

* [*] Portability - enables more transactions and
locations to be analyzed per audit period.

* [*] Real-time continuous video evidence of all
lane activity and toll metrics, with remote video playback

* [*] *_\{not clear what data is on the DVAS server?}_* Real-time
correlation of the in-lane production transactions from
*_\{don't you mean from client cameras?}_* {software-ALPR}
cameras with the Digital Video Audit System (DVAS) video stream

* [*] Intuitive interface to query
the system based on lane transaction ID,
specific time and time range, lane or toll zone,
vehicle license plate (full or partial) and vehicle classification

* [*] Full reports of past transactions and
associated video clips

* [*] Multiple role-based authorization access
for real-time video play or archived recordings -
can be configured per time, lane ID or plaza

== {shortprodname} Equipment

The {shortprodname} solution comes with independent, portable
roadside equipment for recording and processing vehicle data.
The system operates in a fully "touchless" way -
no need for "digging or cutting" the road or building a
new gantry infrastructure.

The {shortprodname} solution
doesn't require any integration with the production
VES equipment. It works in parallel and independently
from the production system, making the entire auditing
process much more accurate and objective.

{shortprodname} roadside equipment includes:

== {shortprodname} Typical Installation

{shortprodname} is designed to be easily
installable and portable, and easy to operate.

In most cases, the system can use existing
production infrastructure such as road gantries,
side poles or cantilevers.

The equipment uses 24 VDC, and requires
no more than 400W of power.

All communication between the cameras and servers
is Ethernet-based.
