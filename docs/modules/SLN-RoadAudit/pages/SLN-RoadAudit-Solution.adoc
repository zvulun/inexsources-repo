== Executive Summary

{shortprodname} uses the same technology
as {compname-short} {software-ALPR} software
to provide a portable, versatile audit
tool for end-users and consultants.
Hardware (separate from the production
system) is installed at target locations,
and vehicle metrics of each transaction
are logged. *_\{seems the opposite - should be the
transaction data w/out the word production; also this
data referred to here are the metrics; only the LPR
is part of the production data}_*
Production transaction data
(axle count, AVC class, LPR) is matched
with {shortprodname} transaction data, this can be
done in real-time or during post-process.

{shortprodname} tools rapidly display mismatched
*_\{what excatly is a mismatched transaction?}_*
transactions *_\{who is doing manual reviews?}_*
which are manually reviewed and *_\{what is disposition
recording?}_* disposition recorded.
Basic reports can be output in CSV format, and
further analyzed by the client. {shortprodname}
can be moved from lane to lane or plaza to plaza,
depending on *_\{call it monitoring needs?}_* testing
needs.

[discrete]
== Key Features and Benefits
* [*] Since {shortprodname} is an independent lane
system, it quickly identifies mismatches in the *_\{when does
the audit period occur?}_* audit period,
providing ~30x reduction in time required *_\{time
required for what?}_* !

* [*] {shortprodname} is not *_\{connected with}_*
tethered to existing production sensors,
providing true independent results.

* [*] *_\{clarify}_* Eliminates contamination of data when
other data logger audit tools are utilized
using production sensors.

* [*] Portability - Enables more transactions and
locations to be analyzed per audit period.

* [*] Video evidence of all toll metrics; for example,
example exiting vehicle edge trigger, image of axle count
*_\{why final?}_* final answer, etc.

*_\{How to integrate the following list with the
list above?}_*

*{shortprodname} provides:*

* [*] Real-time continuous video
recording of lane activity 24/7

* [*] Remote real-time video playback for one or
more tolling lanes' activities

* [*] Real-time correlation of the in-lane
transactions from {software-ALPR} cameras with
the *_\{correct acronym? means what?}_* DVAS video
stream

* [*] Multiple role-based authorization access
for real-time video play or archived recordings.
The role-based access can be configured per time,
lane ID or *_\{what is a plaza location level?}_*
plaza location levels

* [*] Full reports of past transactions and
associated video clips

* [*] Intuitive interface to query
the system based on Lane transaction ID,
specific time and time range, lane or toll zone,
vehicle license plate (full or partial) and
*_\{what are classification results - vehicle type?}_*
classification results

== {shortprodname} Equipment and Installation

The {shortprodname} solution comes with independent, portable
roadside equipment for recording and processing vehicle data.
The system operates in a fully "touchless" way -
no need for "digging or cutting" the road or building a
new gantry infrastructure.

The {shortprodname} solution
doesn't require any integration with the production
VES equipment. It works in parallel and independently
from the production system, making the entire auditing
process much more accurate and objective.

*The {shortprodname} roadside equipment includes:*

== {shortprodname} Equipment Typical Installation

{shortprodname} is designed to be easily
installable and portable, and easy to operate.

In most cases, the system can use existing
production infrastructure such as road gantries,
side poles or cantilevers.

The equipment uses 24 VDC, and requires
no more than 400W of power.

All communication between the cameras and servers
is Ethernet-based.
