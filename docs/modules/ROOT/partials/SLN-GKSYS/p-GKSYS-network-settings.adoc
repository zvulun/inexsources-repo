========================================

The Network Settings refer to the
+++<u>+++{software-ALPR} computer+++</u>+++
(+++<u>+++Camera System)+++</u>+++ - NOT the
computer on which the browser displaying the GUI is running.

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP
address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables
you to access the computer using the same URL every time,
even after unexpected power outages.
