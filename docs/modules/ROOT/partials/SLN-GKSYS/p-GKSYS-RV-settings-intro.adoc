Use the Settings tab after the first installation or
re-installation of the ALPR system, or when some
fundamental parameters need updating.
For example, if the Camera System was moved
to a different location (time zone).

[NOTE]

========================================
Configure the parameters in the order in this
section of the document. For further details,
see the xref:RoadViewALPR:DocList.adoc[{software-ALPR} User Guide].

After clicking the Save button at the end of the
Detector Configuration section, it will take
several seconds before the Live tab
can start displaying Events.
Also, some defaults and/or available
parameters may change, depending on the
Detector Configuration "Mode" selected.
