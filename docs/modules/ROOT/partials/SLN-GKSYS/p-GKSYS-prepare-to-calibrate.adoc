There are two cameras (sensors) in the Camera System.
Both are calibrated in nearly the same way.
The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white,
and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image,
and to perform LPR recognition.
You may even be able to improve read accuracy by
changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer
than the other one.

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of
the capture line. (This is the position at
which the vehicle detector signals that the
vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System
is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the
required capture distance.

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate
at the expected distance and height.
