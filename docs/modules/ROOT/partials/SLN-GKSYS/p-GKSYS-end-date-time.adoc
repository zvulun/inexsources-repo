*Set Time (Automatically/Manually) -
The preferred setting is "Set Time Automatically"*.

* If *Automatic*, the date and time
will be updated from a central NTP (Network Time) server;
the server can be in the cloud or on a local NTP server.
(The default is ntp.ubuntu.com.)

** Enter the NTP server URL

** Select the interval at
which you want {software-ALPR} to poll for the
date and time (selected from the Polling Interval dropdown).

** Click the "Update Now" button to update
the date and time immediately.

** The icon (green check mark or red "x")
indicates if the URL of the NTP server is correct,
and if the connection to it was successful.

* If an NTP server is not available, select  *Manual*.
Click in the *Date and Time* box to display
a calendar/time popup.

* Select a *Time Zone*;
set it to the local time at the location in which the
Camera System/DPU is installed
(+++<u>+++not+++</u>+++ the UTC default).

* Remember to click the Save button at the
end of this section after making changes.
