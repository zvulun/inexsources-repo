[NOTE]

========================================

Each Lane number must be unique in the overall ALPR system.

The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane
will be combined into one Event.

Each "Lane" is actually a virtual Lane. For example,
if you have two Camera Systems capturing the same physical lane,
you will need to create two different "Lanes",
and associate each Camera System's cameras with a different "Lane".
