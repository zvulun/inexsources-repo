[NOTE]
========================================
*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a
fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*.
A fixed IP address enables you to access
the camera using the same URL every time,
even after unexpected power outages.

You can also use {software-discovery} to change
the camera's IP address (see <<s_Related-Documents>>).
========================================

. In the Network group, click on IP Address:

[#f_Changing-the-Camera-s-IP-Address]

.Changing the Camera's IP Address

image::ROOT:/IZA800G/image44.png[image,width=400]

. To change the IP address to a fixed one:
+
[NOTE]
========================================
The IP address must be unique within the entire
ifndef::xref-type-IZA800GVES[ALPR]
ifdef::xref-type-IZA800GVES[VES]
system, and must be within the limits of standard IPv4 address numbering.
========================================

.. Click the Static radio button.

.. Enter the network address parameters (see <<t_IP-Address-Parameters>>). *All cameras must be on the same subnet as both the computer you will use to communicate with and configure the camera, and the {compname-short} {software-ALPR} computer.*

+

[IMPORTANT]
========================================
It is highly recommended to record the camera's IP address and port number in a safe place. You will need them if the camera's parameters are reset back to their defaults, and for configuring {compname-short} recognition software.

After selecting Apply, you will be requested to close your web browser so the updates can take effect. This will take 20 seconds or more, to allow the camera time to reboot. +
- If you click the browser's Back button, all values will be discarded. +
- If you click the browser's Refresh button, the application will load the previous values.

========================================

. In the {software-discovery} utility (see the {software-discovery} User Guide - see <<s_Related-Documents>>), click the "Clear List" button, and verify that the camera can be recognized with the new IP address.
