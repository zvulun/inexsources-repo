[IMPORTANT]

========================================

At the end of this procedure, you will need to check that there is conductivity from the shield wire (at the power supply end of the cable) to the body of the connector that will be connected to the Camera System.

========================================

Use the cable type recommended in the Required Accessories section (see <<s_Required-Accessories>>).

. Lay out the parts from the power connector package.

. Thread the cable through the sealing nut and rubber seal.

. Prepare the cable shielding:

.. Thread the cable all the way through the clamp cage body. Strip off the outer insulation of the cable, leaving the individual insulated wires exposed to a length of 18mm. *Be careful not to cut into the inner foil and plastic jackets (casings) surrounding the individual insulated wires.*

.. Slit the foil jacket, and bend it back onto the outer insulation.

.. Carefully cut away the plastic jacket enclosing the individual insulated wires.

.. Wrap the shield wire (the one without insulation) 1-2 times around the foil jacket that you bent back.

. Peel the backing off of the conductive foil to expose the adhesive.

. Wrap the conductive foil around the point at which the outer insulation was stripped, to cover and make contact with the shield wire and foil jacket.

. Strip off 5 mm from each individual wire. Insert each wire into its appropriate screw terminal, and tighten with a 2 mm flat screwdriver. The suggested wire colors and pinouts are shown in the following Figures. The notch between pins 1 and 2 on the face of the connector corresponds to the notch on the circular body of the screw terminals.
