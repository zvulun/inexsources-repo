[IMPORTANT]

========================================

If you are building your own LAN cables, you must use RJ45 connectors with metal bodies. You must ensure that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable. You can do this by extracting the cable's shield wire before attaching the connector to the cable, and then soldering the shield wire to the body of the connector (see the following Figures).

The outer diameter of the LAN cable must be in the range of 0.20" to 0.25" (5.0 to 6.5 mm).

If you are using prefabricated CAT 5e/6 cables with metal-body RJ45 connectors, the shield wires have typically already been connected to each connector body. However, you must still check that there is conductivity between the bodies of the connectors at each end of the cable.
