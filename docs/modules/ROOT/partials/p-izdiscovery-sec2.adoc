[NOTE]

========================================

The device's IP Address +++<u>+++cannot+++</u>+++ be set to 10.10.2.xx or 10.10.3.xx

*+++<u>+++It is highly recommended to use a fixed IP address (not DHCP)+++</u>+++*. A fixed IP address enables you to access the computer using the same URL every time, even after unexpected power outages (see <<s_Logging-In-and-Logging-Out>>).

A dynamic IP address may change upon device reboot. Before opening the web interface, you will have to find the current IP address of the device using {software-discovery}.

If you want to copy the IP address (for login to the device) you will need to uncheck the DHCP checkbox momentarily to make the address field accessible.

You can also change the IP address using the {shortprodname} Settings tab (see <<s_Network-Settings>>).

========================================

To change the device's mode (fixed or dynamic [DHCP]), or IP address:

. Select the relevant line in the list of devices and double-click on it.

. The Network Settings window appears

. To change the mode:

.. Check or uncheck the DHCP box

.. Click Save

. To change the IP address:

.. *Verify that the address is not used by any other device on the network*

.. Be sure to uncheck the DHCP box

.. Enter the network address parameters

.. Write down the new IP Address and click Save

. The change should be reflected in the main dialog. This can take about a minute until the IP is obtained. If you do not see the change after this time, close {software-discovery}, and then reopen it.

. Verify that the IP address parameters have been changed to the ones you wanted. If not, you will have to log into the device (see <<s_Logging-In-and-Logging-Out>>) and change the IP address (see <<s_Network-Settings>>).
