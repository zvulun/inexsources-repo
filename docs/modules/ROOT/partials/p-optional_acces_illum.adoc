* External Illuminator - Can be used to enhance overview vehicle image quality, for front and/or rear capture. It is recommended to use an illuminator power supply separate from the Camera System's supply.
** Mount illuminators at an appropriate distance away from their associated Camera System(s), according to the objectives of your project. Contact INEX for guidance/training about this subject.
** Position the illuminator so you can aim it at the place where vehicles pass for recognition - while minimizing the glare into drivers' eyes. In most cases, however, white illuminators are mounted to be aimed at the rear of vehicles. Illuminator aiming is most effective at night.
