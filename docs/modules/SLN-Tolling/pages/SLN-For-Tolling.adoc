== Executive Summary

*_/{I have avoided giving the impression that our
system can optimize traffic flow in the executive summary;
it would sound like Waze....but later on we do put in that
toll roads can optimize traffic flow (the hint is that
people will want to use the toll road to avoid congestion)}_*

Toll roads
are an important part of transportation strategies for
streamlining ever-expanding traffic flow and reducing congestion.
Traditional tolling falls short of the  need for
user-friendly, reliable and scalable toll collection.
{empty} +

{compname-short}'s advanced tolling system is a game-changer.
Using high resolution cameras, AI-driven
license plate recognition and a sophisticated billing system,
{compname-short} transforms roads into smart highways.
The use of eWallets ensures swift seamless transactions,
no matter how complex a customer's journey through different
tolling zones at different times.

* [*] Comprehensive Video Analytics
* [*] Integration with Existing Equipment
* [*] AlphaV Billing System
* [*] AlphaV eWallet

== ALPR AI Cameras and Illuminators

*_/{TBD: picture(s)}_*

The foundation of {compname-short}'s toll road solution
lies in its state-of-the-art ALPR
(Advanced License Plate Recognition) cameras.
These AI-powered cameras, together with
dedicated illuminators, ensure real-time,
clear capture of vehicles -
even on high-speed open roads, day or night, under
any weather conditions.

[discrete]
== Comprehensive Video Analytics

*_/{TBD: picture(s)}_*

{compname-short}'s sophisticated algorithms not only capture
basic plate details, but delve deeper by identifying:

* *_/{but isn't this obvious? what else to mention -
based on department of transporation registration records}_* Plate ID: vehicle identification

* *State of Issue:* State or region of the plate's origin

* *Vehicle Type:* Such as commercial, private, government

* *_/{can we promise this?}_* Color

* *_/{can we promise this?}_* Make

== Integration with Existing Equipment

*_/{TBD: picture(s)}_*

Your existing equipment can be seamlessly integrated
with the {compname-short} system, for example:

* *RFID:* Radio Frequency Identification is supported, adding
to the user's options for contactless toll payments.

* *Gate Control:* {compname-short}'s solution manages
gate control mechanisms, ensuring unimpeded vehicle
flow while upholding security standards.

== AlphaV Billing System

*_/{TBD: picture(s)}_*

{compname-short}â€™s innovative AlphaV Billing System
encompasses:

* *Consolidated Bills:* *_/{original said "open billing" which
isnt't specific enough; I changed it to Consolidated}_*
Constructs a unified bill by combining multiple toll
transactions, providing a user-friendly billing approach

* *Entry/Exit Point Billing:* *_/{original said "closed billing"
which wasn't clear enough; I changed it to Entry/Exit Point
Billing}_*
Charges are determined based on
entry and exit points of vehicles on specific
road segments, ensuring accurate and fair billing

* *Dynamic Road Pricing:* Tailors toll fees based on
variables such as vehicle type, time of day, congestion,
and other relevant factors. This dynamic approach not
only optimizes revenue but also manages traffic flow,
potentially reducing peak-time congestion.

* *Multiple Payment Sources:* Bank, credit card, eWallet

== AlphaV eWallet

*_/{TBD: picture(s)}_*

The {compname-short} eWallet app isn't just about
making payments - it's a complete digital bank account
tailored for convenience. Its outstanding feature is
streamlining open road tolling. Imagine driving without
the need for stops or searching for change; the
eWallet handles tolls effortlessly.
But there's so much more to offer...
{empty} +

Beyond basic transactions, eWallet gives users more value
for their money. They can earn cashback and rewards, turning
everyday payments into savings opportunities. Plus, for those
who appreciate a good deal, the app showcases special ads and
tailored promotions. Whether it's discounts at a favorite
store, cashback on tolls, or exclusive offers, the {compname-short}
eWallet becomes a one-stop digital hub for transactions,
savings, and exciting rewards.
