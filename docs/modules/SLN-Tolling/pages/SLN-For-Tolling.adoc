== Executive Summary

*_/{I have avoided giving the impression that our
system can optimize traffic flow in the executive summary;
it would sound like Waze....but later on we do put in that
toll roads can optimize traffic flow (the hint is that
people will want to use the toll road to avoid congestion)}_*

Toll roads
are an important part of transportation strategies for
streamlining ever-expanding traffic flow and reducing congestion.
Traditional tolling falls short of the  need for
user-friendly, reliable and scalable toll collection.
