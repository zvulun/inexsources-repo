== Use {software-discovery} and Allocate IP Addresses

. Allocate 3 consecutive IP addresses for
the onboard processor and the
LPR and OV cameras (sensors).
For example: +
* Processor - http://192.168.5.100/ +
* LPR Camera - http://192.168.5.101/ +
* OV Camera - http://192.168.5.102/ +

. Use {software-discovery} to find the
onboard processor and LPR/OV cameras, and to
change their IP addresses to the ones
you allocated.

== Prepare to Aim and Calibrate

There are two cameras (sensors) in the Camera System.
Both are calibrated in nearly the same way.
The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white,
and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image,
and to perform LPR recognition.
You may even be able to improve read accuracy by
changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer
than the other one.

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of
the capture line. (This is the position at
which the vehicle detector signals that the
vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System
is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the
required capture distance.

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate
at the expected distance and height.

Use the Settings tab after the first installation or
re-installation of the ALPR system, or when some
fundamental parameters need updating.
For example, if the Camera System was moved
to a different location (time zone).

[NOTE]

========================================
Configure the parameters in the order in this
section of the document.

After clicking the Save button at the end of the
Detector Configuration section, it will take
several seconds before the Live tab
can start displaying Events.

Each Lane number must be unique in the overall ALPR system.

The images from all cameras capturing the same physical lane
will be combined into a single Event.

Each "Lane" is actually a virtual Lane. For example,
if you have two Camera Systems capturing the same physical lane,
you will need to create two different "Lanes",
and associate each Camera System's cameras with a different "Lane".

.Calibration Tab

image::ROOT:SLN-TIBA/RV-TIBA-FIG-011a_CalibrationTab.png[image,800]

. When you see a vehicle at a typical
capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it.

. It is recommended to use the view called
"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)".
You select this view by clicking on the right-most button
at the upper left of the
screen: image:RoadViewALPR:UserGuide/image38.png[image,30]

. Select a camera from the dropdown list (LPR or OV).

. The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical)
are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically.

. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date
and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera.

. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket's adjustment
hardware (see <<f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments>>).

.. *Pan*: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license
plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View.

.. *Tilt:* Adjust the Tilt so that the image
of every expected plate position
(depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars,
jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen
(from top to bottom).

.. *Roll*: Adjust the Roll so the license plate's
image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground
(not tilted to one side).
+
[#f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments]

.Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments

image::ROOT:RoadViewALPR/PanTiltRoll.png[image,width=311,height=186]

. When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary
tightening of the mounting screws.

. Define the Region of Interest (*ROI*) by dragging
on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region.
For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be
large enough to capture the region where plates
could be found in images.
+
[NOTE]

========================================

The following settings for the LPR and OV cameras are saved
separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest
that is different for each camera.

========================================

. Define the *Plate Width Min*: Events will only be created
for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal
to this parameter. Enter the desired value
in the *Plate Width Min* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging the
small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab
(expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads.
For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far
away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human.

. Define the *Plate Width Max*: Events will only be
created for plate reads whose width is less than or
equal to this parameter. Enter
the desired value in the *Plate Width Max* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging
the large circle on the horizontal line on the
Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to prevent false reads,
such as large numbers on trucks.

. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust
the view of the video until the width of the plate
is *_\{still true?}_* 150 pixels, and its plate image is clear and sharp.
(The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body,
do not need to be as sharp as the plate.)
+
[IMPORTANT]

========================================

There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button
and when you see the effect on the screen.
Be sure to wait until you see the change
on the screen before clicking the button again.
Clicking the button multiple times will cause you
to "overshoot" the desired zoom/focus.

As you adjust the zoom and focus,
you may need to reposition the camera in order to
get the image of the plate back to the desired position.

========================================

. *Direction (red arrow on video):* Not used

. When you have finished, click the *Save* button.
Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically,
which indicates that the {software-ALPR} recognition software
is running again with the updated parameters.

. When the correct position is achieved, make a final
tightening of the mounting hardware.

. Repeat these steps for the other camera.

[#s_Verify-System-Operation]

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab,
or by driving a vehicle through the lane,
verify that an Event is generated with the
correct plate read, as recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal)
tab.

.Live (Journal) Tab

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated
for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition
has sufficient accuracy and confidence.

* You can use the Search tab to find Event records stored in the
{software-ALPR} database.

* Verify that each camera's IP address in the Camera System, and the {software-ALPR} computer's IP address are all on the same subnet.

* Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load.

* Verify that the IP address(es) configured in {software-ALPR} match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s). See <<s_Cameras>>.

* On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence

* On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max

Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab:

* If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the Camera System so that the each camera's field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate's images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible.

* If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the Camera System with a soft cloth and mild soap

* If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of each camera.
