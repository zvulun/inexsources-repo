removable pole mount}_* IZMNTA-WE{plus}MNT-PMA -  pole mount

== Use {software-discovery} and Allocate IP Addresses

. Allocate 3 consecutive IP addresses for
the onboard Jetson processor and the
LPR and OV sensors.
For example: +
* Processor - http://192.168.5.100/ +
* LPR Sensor - http://192.168.5.101/ +
* OV Sensor - http://192.168.5.102/ +

. Use {software-discovery} to find the
Jetson processor and LPR/OV sensors, and to
change their IP addresses to the ones
you allocated.

== Configure LPR/OV Camera Settings

[#s_Logging-In-to-the-Camera]

=== Logging In to a Camera

include::ROOT:partial$IZA800G/p-camera-logging-in.adoc[Logging in to the Camera]

=== Configure the LPR Camera

==== LiveView (link at upper right)
* The focus will be set automatically;
can be fine-adjusted manually with buttons
* Use the buttons to Zoom in/out

==== Admin (link at upper right)

* Enter username and password (root/IZpass12)
* Use the menu at the left to select the parameter
category/sub-category/group.
+
[IMPORTANT]
==================
*After changing settings, remember to
click the Apply button at the bottom of
each parameter section.*
==================

==== Video &gt; Device &gt; Video Streams

image::ROOT:SLN-TIBA/IZA500G-FIG-110_TIBALPRVideoStreams.png[image,800]

Set: +

* Max Video Encoding (at bottom) = 2M x 30 fps
+
[IMPORTANT]
==================
*Change this parameter first.
Changing this parameter will require a reset,
which can change some of the other parameters.*
==================

* Primary Stream Frame Rate = 15 fps
* Primary Stream Image Size = 1920 x 1080
* Primary Stream Encoding Standard = M-JPEG

===== Video &amp; Device &gt; Video Streams &gt; Camera Settings

image::ROOT:SLN-TIBA/IZA500G-FIG-112a_TIBALPRCameraSettings.png[image,800]

*_\{recheck this bullet - unclear - is this
default day shown here?}_*

* Click Default(Day) at the top of the parameter table
*_\{(not shown here???}_*

Set:

* Shutter Time Min = 1/500 - 1/32000
* Shutter Time Max = equal to Time Min
+
[NOTE]
=====================
If the image is too dark at night, increase
shutter Time Min/Max. However, higher (longer)
shutter speeds may cause smearing at higher
vehicle speeds.
=====================

* Max AGC gain = 1 - 36
+
[NOTE]
=====================
Use 36 for the lowest noise;
however, if the image moves,
increase this value (but the image will be less clear)
=====================

* Day and Night Control = Black & White

*_\{put in headings, text and config screens from pinchas'
rough draft}_*

== Aim and Calibrate

There are two cameras (sensors) in the Camera System.
Both are calibrated in nearly the same way.
The LPR camera is set to capture in black and white,
and the Overview (OV) camera is set to capture in color.

The OV camera can be used both to display an overview image,
and to perform LPR recognition.
You may even be able to improve read accuracy by
changing the zoom to have one camera "see" closer
than the other one.

[#s_Preparing-a-Vehicle-License-Plate]

=== Preparing a Vehicle/License Plate

Move a vehicle next to, and at the middle of
the capture line. (This is the position at
which the vehicle sensor signals that the
vehicle is present.) Ensure that the Camera System
is aimed at the middle of the lane, and is at the
required capture distance.

Alternatively, in a lab, position a license plate
at the expected distance and height.

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras-Using-RoadView]

=== Calibrating the Cameras Using {software-ALPR}

*_\{put in Pinchas' rough draft and Max's screens, etc.}_*


[#s_Verify-System-Operation]

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab, or by driving a vehicle through the lane, verify that an Event is generated with the correct plate read (recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal) tab - see the {software-ALPR-long} User Guide). See <<s_Related-Documents>>.

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition has sufficient accuracy and confidence.
