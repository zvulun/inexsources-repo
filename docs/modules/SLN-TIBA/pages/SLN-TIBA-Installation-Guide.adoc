You can capture a vehicle
(and create an Event) at a different
position than the location of the in-ground loop.
Use this Trigger Offset parameter to capture
the vehicle before or after the loop.

For example, in this illustration, the loop is directly
under the barrier bar. Setting the Trigger Offset
to -200 will move the capture point up
the lane, and capture the plate before
it is obstructed from view by the bar.

[#s_Calibrating-the-Cameras-Using-RoadView]

== Calibrating the Cameras Using {software-ALPR}

[#f_Calibration-Tab]

.Calibration Tab

image::ROOT:SLN-TIBA/RV-TIBA-FIG-011a_CalibrationTab.png[image,800]

. When you see a vehicle at a typical
capture position on the video, click on the video to pause it.

. It is recommended to use the view called
"Draw image by maintaining aspect ratio (two-headed arrow)".
You select this view by clicking on the right-most button
at the upper left of the
screen: image:RoadViewALPR:UserGuide/image38.png[image,30]

. Select a camera from the dropdown list (LPR or OV).

. The Frame Width (horizontal) and Frame Height (vertical)
are displayed at the lower left, and are set automatically.

. The Frame Timestamp at the lower left displays the date
and time that the image is being taken/was taken by the camera.

. Aim the camera using the mounting bracket's adjustment
hardware (see <<f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments>>).

.. *Pan*: Adjust the Pan so that the image of the license
plate is in the horizontal middle of the Field of View.

.. *Tilt:* Adjust the Tilt so that the image
of every expected plate position
(depending on the vehicle type, such as passenger cars,
jeeps, trucks, etc.) will be in the middle of the screen
(from top to bottom).

.. *Roll*: Adjust the Roll so the license plate's
image is horizontally straight, parallel to the ground
(not tilted to one side).
+
[#f_Pan-Tilt-Roll-Angle-Adjustments]

.Pan/Tilt/Roll (Angle) Adjustments

image::ROOT:RoadViewALPR/PanTiltRoll.png[image,width=311,height=186]

. When the correct position is achieved, make a preliminary
tightening of the mounting screws.

. Define the Region of Interest (*ROI*) by dragging
on the corners (vertices) of the trapezoidal region.
For optimum recognition accuracy, the ROI should be
large enough to capture the region where plates
could be found in images.
+
[NOTE]

========================================

The following settings for the LPR and OV cameras are saved
separately. For example, you may want a Region of Interest
that is different for each camera.

========================================

. Use the zoom and focus buttons to adjust
the view of the video until the width of the plate
is withing the extent of the vertices, and
its plate image is clear and sharp.
(The surrounding items, such as the vehicle body,
do not need to be as sharp as the plate.)
+
[IMPORTANT]
========================================
There is a delay between a click of a zoom/focus button
and when you see the effect on the screen.
Be sure to wait until you see the change
on the screen before clicking the button again.
Clicking the button multiple times will cause you
to "overshoot" the desired zoom/focus.

As you adjust the zoom and focus,
you may need to reposition the camera in order to
get the image of the plate back to the desired position.
========================================

. Define the *Plate Width Min*: Events will only be created
for plate reads whose width is greater than or equal
to this parameter. Enter the desired value
in the *Plate Width Min* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging the
small circle on the horizontal line on the Calibration tab
(expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to ignore small plate reads.
For example, if the image was taken when a vehicle is too far
away, the characters are too small to be read - even by a human.

. Define the *Plate Width Max*: Events will only be
created for plate reads whose width is less than or
equal to this parameter. Enter
the desired value in the *Plate Width Max* text box. +
This parameter can also be configured by dragging
the large circle on the horizontal line on the
Calibration tab (expressed in pixels). +
This parameter can be used to prevent false reads,
such as large numbers on trucks.

. *Direction (red arrow on video):* Not used

. When you have finished, click the *Save* button.
Wait several seconds for the display to refresh automatically,
which indicates that the {software-ALPR} recognition software
is running again with the updated parameters.

. When the correct position is achieved, make a final
tightening of the mounting hardware.

. Repeat these steps for the other camera.

[#s_Verify-System-Operation]

== Verify System Operation

* Using a license plate mounted in a lab,
or by driving a vehicle through the lane,
verify that an Event is generated with the
correct plate read, as recorded in the {software-ALPR} Live (Journal)
tab.

.Live (Journal) Tab

image::ROOT:SLN-TIBA/RV-TIBA-FIG-009a_LiveTab.png[image,800]

* Once the lane is active, verify that Events are being generated
for each vehicle passing each camera, and that the recognition
has sufficient accuracy and confidence.

* You can use the Search tab to find Event records stored in the
{software-ALPR} database.

Page Elements:

* *Total Lanes* - Total number of lanes in the system

* *Operational Lanes* - Lanes with
cameras operating properly

* *Require Maintenance* - Lanes with cameras
that are operating but need maintenance/have warnings
(for future use)

* *Inoperational Lanes* - Lanes with
cameras not operating

////
*_\{The read rate for the last day
We only use a maximum of 1000 events from the Review Tool;
The reviewed events are only qualified (human-readable) reads;
Numbers in tooltips are the number of reads reviewed -
usually only about 80% of total eVents for the day
because he rest are non-qualified}_*
////


* *Statistic Graphs*
These graphs show data from "reviewed reads".
"Reviewed reads" are the Qualifed (human-readable) plate reads
(out of the total reads for a certain day) that were reviewed.

** *Read Rate Bar Chart* (for online/operational cameras):

*** Hover over a bar to show details for the previous day's
review.

*** Click to jump to the Last Review
page for that lane (see <<s_Last-Review>>).

** *Historical Average Read Rate* - Each data point
is generated daily. Hover on a point to show details.

The Lanes page enables you to (see <<f_IZCloud-Lanes-Page>>):

* View live video

* View the license plate read for the current Event

* Correct the plate read

* Open the lane's gate in an emergency

[NOTE]
======================
Plate images and video are displayed for
lanes with online/operational cameras.

Live video is only displayed if your site's
security policy allows transmitting the outbound
video stream from the camera.

* Verify that each camera's IP address in the Camera System, and the {software-ALPR} computer's IP address are all on the same subnet.

* Verify that stable power at the correct level is being supplied to the cameras, even when under a heavy processing load.

* Verify that the IP address(es) configured in {software-ALPR} match the IP addresses that you configured in the camera(s). See <<s_Cameras>>.

|Recognition rates are low a|
* On the Calibration tab, increase the size of the Region of Interest (ROI) - it may be too small to capture plates with high confidence

* On the Calibration tab, try to reduce the Plate Width Min and increase the Plate Width Max

Examine the video from the Camera on the Calibration tab:

* If all license plates are not fully visible, re-aim the Camera System so that the each camera's field of view fully covers the capture zone. For a more precise adjustment, verify that the license plate's images are as close to the middle of the video display as possible.

* If the images are spotted, remove dirt and dust from the front window of the Camera System with a soft cloth and mild soap

* If the images are not sharp, adjust the zoom and focus of each camera.
